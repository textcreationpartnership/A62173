            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS without any other Knowledge of you, than what Fame has every where ſuggeſted to me, that I preſume to make you this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. I may be a Stranger to your Perſon; but to your Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits it's impoſſible: Your Goodneſs and Vertue ſet you before every Man's Eyes; and 'tis no eaſie matter to publiſh any thing, and not take notice of you. He that ventures himſelf in Print, ought to pitch on ſome proper Patron to defend his Work (for ſure the firſt Dedicator was ſomething of a Prophet, to foreſee the Neceſſity of Criticiſm,) And where can ſuch Qualifications be ſo happily found, as in you, where Wit and Judgment contend for Pre-eminence? Wit pleads its
<pb facs="tcp:105141:4"/>Quickneſs and Force on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Judgment its Solidity and ſtrong Reaſoning. So that theſe Powerful Conſiderations, join'd with humble Reflections on your Birth and Quality, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to think of any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron for the <hi>Preſent State</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Alſo I was in hopes of ſerving my Country, by promoting Thoughts of Travel in a Perſon ſo well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified (for nothing like Voyages ſerves to further thoſe Inclinations) who might return home, ſtor'd with all the Advantages of foreign Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and ſo become a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformer of his own. Moſt Travellers come back only fraught with Garbs and Faſhions, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd with the ill Cuſtoms and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Places they paſs thro': But you, no doubt, Sir, would agree with <hi>Lipſius,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Lanonius,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, Luſtrare, Diſquirere, Cogitare, hoc eſt verè Peregrinari.</hi> The Merchant
<pb facs="tcp:105141:4"/>in his Travels propoſes <hi>bonum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;</hi> the diſſolute, rich, young, vain Fellow, <hi>bonum Jucundum;</hi> but your well-bred ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, only <hi>bonum Honeſtum &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Patriae.</hi> What Advantages Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel brings to all Profeſſions, I am ſure you are not ignorant of, and that there is no Artiſt or Learned Man thoroughly improv'd without it. The <hi>French</hi> have a Saying, That a Traveller is <hi>Homme mêlé,</hi> a Man that is acquainted with all Nations, and who knows how to avoid the Pride of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Poiſon of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Treachery of <hi>France,</hi> and the Drunkenneſs of <hi>Flanders;</hi> alſo is throughly ſatisfied, that <hi>France</hi> is a good Country to ride thro', <hi>Italy</hi> to look upon, <hi>Spain</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but <hi>England</hi> to live in. Theſe things, Sir, I am bold to mention, as farther Motives to any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may have for Travel, by which the beſt and moſt ingenions Man in the World is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd:
<pb facs="tcp:105141:5"/>And if hereafter you ſhould chance to reach <hi>Perſia,</hi> you will find it what it is here deſcrib'd (for our Author is of unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reputation) a Kingdom one of the moſt powerful and conſiderable in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> whether it be for its Government, Force, Riches, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or Antiquity; and which laſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> have an undoubted Title to; the <hi>Aſſyrians, Medians,</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> having all begun their Empires there.</p>
            <p>The Author of this preſent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, was a Miſſionary ſent into <hi>Perſia</hi> by the King of <hi>France,</hi> to propagate his Glory and Grandeur, I believe, rather than Religion: For whoever reflects on his daily Practices at home can he believe him well inclin'd ſo far off? But however, allowing it to be ſo, he differs very much in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For there his <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> are Mild and Patient (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has it) when at home they are
<pb facs="tcp:105141:5"/>Cruel and Severe. 'Tis obſervable that he makes uſe of other Perſons; for there they are Fawning <hi>Black-Coats,</hi> but here they are Bluſt'ring <hi>Red.</hi> So that to reconcile theſe Two to be intended for the ſame End, I know no better way, than by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, That his Religion is Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his God, Power.</p>
            <p>The great diſtance of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Perſia</hi> (which ſome might make an Objection againſt the minding of it) does but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend its Deſcription the more to all ingenious Men: For who would not be willing to be acquainted with the Laws and Cuſtoms of ſo remote and Polite a People, who at leaſt have ſomething in 'em worthy to be imitated? Imitation being the great Concern of Life, and on which all Humane Knowledge is founded: For if you read and approve, you imitate; if you ſee and like, you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; if you hear and are pleas'd, you imitate; that is, it ſinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
<pb facs="tcp:105141:6"/>into you, and is always of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to be made uſe of upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when Motives of meer Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, without much Attention, are but Shadows and trivial in every thing.</p>
            <p>Now as to theſe Travels being Authentick, I have this to ſay, That our Author was one of the lateſt Travellers into thoſe Parts, and perhaps made the longeſt Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there. I know, that others do differ from him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names of Places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but I thought it not ſafe to follow 'em; neither had it been juſtifiable in a bare Tranſlator.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have done my ſelf an Honour that none have had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and I hope to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it the better to your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Goodneſs, by its being my <hi>Maiden Addreſs,</hi> and which is no leſs humbly Offer'd, than ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb facs="tcp:105141:6"/>and honeſtly Meant, by him that will be glad of all further Occaſions of expreſſing himſelf,</p>

            <head>A Short Introduction OF THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Was ſent into <hi>Perſia</hi> in the Year <hi>1683.</hi> to labour in the <hi>Miſſions;</hi> where my firſt care was to make my ſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Armenian, Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongues, believing that without them I could not be very ſerviceable; I was young, and therefore had not much trouble to learn them. I have had occaſion in the Accompliſhment of my Miniſtry to traverſe many Provinces of <hi>Perſia.</hi> I was firſt ſent to <hi>Casbin,</hi> which was heretofore the Metropolis of the Kingdom. I employed my ſelf there Eight Months in inſtructing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Christians thereabouts; and I ſpent the remaining part of the year in <hi>Lower Aſſyria.</hi> I have run through at divers times, the Kingdoms of the <hi>Elamites</hi> and <hi>Suſa,</hi> little frequented by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and leſs known by any Relation of them. The reſt of my time I ſpent in informing my ſelf of the <hi>Manners, Situation,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Countrie But that which chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb facs="tcp:105141:7"/>to my entire Knowledge of the Court of <hi>Perſia</hi> was the long ſtay I made there. At firſt I paſt Eight Months with the Biſhop of <hi>Babylon;</hi> where ſome Injuries being offered us by the People of <hi>Hamadan,</hi> upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of his Death, (the care of his Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being left to us) I was forc'd to go to Court to complain, where I ſtay'd no leſs than Three Years: During which time our King was pleaſed to ſend a Recommendatory Letter, on our behalf, to the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> which did not go without its Effect; for we had immediate Juſtice done us. It was upon this Occaſion that the King did me the Honour to admit me into the number of his <hi>Gueſts;</hi> (for ſo they term all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> of Princes.) By means of this Quality I had admittance into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, which is only allowed to the great Lords of <hi>Perſia.</hi> I aſſisted at all Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which the King gave, and had my Place aſſign'd me at all Publick Feaſts. This Prince has now ſent me home with Letters to our King. And his Majeſty has been pleas'd to command me to make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of my Memoirs of <hi>Perſia;</hi> which I have done, purſuant to my Duty: And I am apt to believe that the publick will not take it much amiſs if I oblige them with this Impreſſion.</p>

               <p n="3">3. I ſhall explain their Methods of adminiſtring Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What relates moſt to my Miniſtry, and what ſeems moſt important; I ſhall diſcourſe of their ancient and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Religions.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the King</note> therefore. Altho' the King of <hi>PERSIA</hi> be abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign over more than Twelve vaſt and famous Kingdoms, yet he takes upon him no other Title than that of <hi>CHA,</hi> which ſignifies no more than <hi>King;</hi> yet nevertheleſs his Subjects believe him to be the moſt Magnificent,
<note place="margin">His Titles.</note> Potent, and Abſolute of that kind in all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They call him alſo <hi>Alam Pena,</hi> which is as much as to ſay <hi>The Protection and Sanctuary of all Nations.</hi> And which glorious Name is given him with no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary juſtice; for of all the Kings of <hi>Aſia</hi> none receives Strangers better, loves 'em ſincerer, or allows 'em greater Privileges and Advantages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and the <hi>Usbeg-Tartars,</hi> who are his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105141:9"/>Enemies, never afford him any other Title than that of <hi>Chiek Ogli,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>the Son of a Prieſt,</hi> becauſe the latter Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> have been of the Race of <hi>Chiek Sephi,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Cha-Iſmael,</hi> firſt King of that Branch. But the <hi>Perſians,</hi> inſtead of being offended at this deſign'd Affront, do chuſe rather to glory in it, becauſe that <hi>Chiek Sephi</hi> was deſcended from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Son of a Grandchild of <hi>Falma</hi>'s, only Daughter to this falſe Prophet, who was beſtowed by him in Marriage upon <hi>Mortus Ali,</hi> whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> believe to be his trueſt Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. It was this famous <hi>Chiek Sephi,</hi> who with the aſſiſtance of the Lords of <hi>Media,</hi> reſtored <hi>Perſia</hi> to its former Glory, after it had been invaded, and almoſt ruined by <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> This ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who carried his victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arms even into the very Bowels of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> was named <hi>Tamour,</hi> and ſirnamed <hi>Lang,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Lame,</hi> becauſe he really was ſo. For this reaſon therefore the People took occaſion to give him the name of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> which is but a corruption of <hi>Tamour-Lang,</hi> which he never diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being the firſt that ridicul'd himſelf
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105141:10"/>for that defect: For having taken <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> in that famous Victory of his near the City of <hi>Angorie</hi> in <hi>Galatia,</hi> in the beginning of the Fifteenth <hi>Century,</hi> he cauſed him to be brought under his Pavillion, where as ſoon as he had ſeen him, he immediately began to laugh heartily: When <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who was very far from abating any of his <hi>Pride,</hi> even in diſgrace, and which he afterwards made good, tho' he was ſhut up in an Iron Cage, believing this <hi>Prince</hi> inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his Misfortunes, broke out with Indignation into theſe Words: <hi>You need not be ſo much puft up with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you have gained over me, ſince You know by Experience, it is equally in the power ef Fortune to make a Slave or a Conqueror.</hi> To which <hi>Tamerlan</hi> replied, <hi>I am better acquainted with the inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Humane Affairs than to mock at your preſent Miſery. But</hi> (added he) <hi>in beholding You and My ſelf, I cannot forbear laughing at the fantaſtical choice Fortune has made of two Men to govern the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Aſia, You having but one Eye, and I but one Leg.</hi> And truly this <hi>Prince</hi> ought to have been very ſenſible of the favours of Fortune, for from a <hi>Shepherd</hi> he was rais'd to force the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105141:10"/>Walls of <hi>China,</hi> and to extend his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts over the greateſt part of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> But his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> knew how to profit ſo little by his Victories, that they gave way to <hi>Chiek Sephi</hi> to reſtore the Empire of <hi>Perſia</hi> which their Father had ſubdued.</p>
               <p>The preſent King was call'd <hi>Cha Sephi</hi> at his coming to the Crown:
<note place="margin">His Name, and the change of it</note> But 'tis reported that the <hi>Jews</hi> having pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed ſome Sorcery upon his <hi>Perſon,</hi> he was at length reduc'd to that languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, that he was ready to drop down dead, when <hi>Chiek-Ali-Kan,</hi> his <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> or <hi>Chief Miniſter,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their malice, advis'd him to change his <hi>Name,</hi> to prevent their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any power over him: Whereupon he aſſum'd the Name of <hi>Solyman</hi> for that of <hi>Sephi,</hi> which had belong'd to his <hi>Grandfather,</hi> and the famous <hi>Chiek Sephi</hi> before him.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Solyman</hi> is at preſent in the Twenty Seventh Year of his <hi>Reign,</hi>

His Air is affable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>Majeſtick:</hi> He is ſo very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, that when you but bow to him he ſeems in ſome meaſure to return it, by a courteous inclining of his Head, and which he always does ſmiling: He has a maſculine and agreeable Voice, a great deal of ſweetneſs in his manner of ſpeaking; and his Shape and Perſon are enclin'd to the Talleſt.</p>
               <p>He has often given ſufficient proofs of his great ſtrength of Body,

<note place="margin">His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</note> He manages a <hi>Scymiter</hi> with a great deal of <hi>Addreſs.</hi> And in ſhort, there is not one <hi>Noble-Man</hi> of all his Court, that can in the leaſt come near him for any other <hi>Exerciſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is of a very bountiful ſoft and ſober <hi>Nature.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105141:24"/>all the Great Lords, and reflected upon, as one that executes the Office of a Gaoler and Bailiff.</p>
               <p>All the other Lords, or Officers, I have ſpoken of, are <hi>Megdeles-Rou's;</hi> that is to ſay, They have all Places at the King's Feaſts. All thoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and all <hi>Kans</hi> are ſtyl'd <hi>Omara's,</hi> that is,

               <p>'Tis eaſie to gueſs, by the Number of Officers I have nam'd, how great is the Magnificence of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court: But becauſe it never appears more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did than when the King invites all his Grandees to a Banquet,
<note place="margin">The King's Palace.</note> I ſhall go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Deſcription of both his Palace and the Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Altho' the Buildings in <hi>Perſia</hi> have not that exactneſs in their Structure as thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi>

And I believe there never yet was any one of us, who had ſeen the Palace of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but was immediately ſurpris'd with its Beauty. It is built on the Weſt-ſide of the great Place call'd <hi>Meidan,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Market.</hi> This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105141:25"/>Market-place is the prettieſt Spot of Ground in all the Eaſt: It is of great extent, and longer than large: Its length is ſeven hundred Paces, and breadth of it but three: The four Sides are rais'd in Portico's, of the ſame Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with the Wings of the Entrance into the Palace, as you may ſee by the Deſign I have here taken of it. The young <hi>Perſian</hi> Lords exerciſe themſelves in this place,
<note place="margin">Exerciſes of young Lords.</note> with playing at Mall on Horſe back, throwing the Lance, and then catching it again before they quit their Stirrups; and by drawing the Bow behind 'em at full ſpeed, according to the cuſtom of the ancient <hi>Parthians.</hi> They ſhoot at a Mark in a Plate of Gold, which is fix'd to a Pole rais'd in the middle of the Market. The King, who ſees this Exerciſe from his Hall of Audience, gives a Reward, together with the golden Plate, to him that brings it to the ground. He alſo ſends him a Preſent of Four hundred Crowns, to defray the Charges of a Collation, which he does him the Honour to come to take at his Houſe. And all the Lords go to congratulate his Skill and this Honour has been done him.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:105141:25"/>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide of this place, and over-againſt the King's Palace, appears a ſtately <hi>Moſque,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fine Moſque.</note> whoſe <hi>Dome</hi> is a very bold Work, by reaſon of its largeneſs. The out-ſide of it is painted like Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celain, and 'tis encompaſs'd round with a white Liſt of two foot broad, wherein are carv'd a certain number of great <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Characters.</hi> The Globe and Creſcent, which are on the top of it, are gilded. Its Porch is of Marble, and enrich'd with a great deal of curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</p>
               <p>In one of the Corners of this <hi>Meidan,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide,
<note place="margin">Another great Moſque,</note> is that Great Royal Moſque which <hi>Cha Abbas</hi> the Great, dedicated to <hi>Methi,</hi> the laſt of the Twelve <hi>Imans,</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Saints. They call him alſo <hi>Sahab Zaman,</hi> that is to ſay, The Maſter of Time.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105141:26"/>height, and compos'd of Marble of many colours, and has alſo a white Liſt about it at the top, which continues all over the Portico's and Body of the Moſque, and fill'd with Characters as the former. The Front is painted with Varniſh'd Azure, and ſometimes intermix'd with many Leaves and Feſtoons of Gold. The upper part of the Frontiſpiece is of Plaiſter rais'd into an emboſs'd Oval all over ſprig'd and ſpeckl'd with Gold; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over wrought in ſo curious a manner, that I believe they could not manage their Trowel better any where. This Gate is all over Pannels of Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion gilded: You enter by it into a very large Court, ſurrounded with Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, whoſe Columns are of Granite Marble. The Heads, Corniches, and Frizes of theſe Galleries, are of Azure and Gold. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſay their Prayers under them, after they have purified themſelves in the great Marble Baſons in the middle of the Court. The Moſque is on the right-hand; you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it by a very ſtately Arch, which is embelliſh'd, painted, and gilded after the ſame manner with the Gallerier. The body of the Moſque is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105141:26"/>and it has a double <hi>Dome</hi> of the ſame Structure with that of the former.</p>
               <p>There are before theſe <hi>Domes</hi> two <hi>Minarés,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſort of Steeples.</note> enrich'd with inlaid or Sprig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: They are a ſort of little Steeples built with Brick, which are ſo ſlender and very high, that one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they could ſupport themſelves. They have but one winding Stair-caſe, which is ſo narrow, that ſcarce one Man can go up at a time, and which is caus'd in great meaſure by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wall, and which is ſcarce broader at the bottom than the top. The <hi>Ottomans</hi> make their <hi>Moullas,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> cry from the top of theſe <hi>Minarés,</hi> to call their People to Prayers;

The <hi>Moullah</hi> coming to theſe Steps, kicks the Bottles before him, when the Wine having made his Way ſlippery, he was not long before he reach'd the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, with no ſmall damage to his Bones. The Out cries he made, preſently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the <hi>Mahometans</hi> to go ſee what had happen'd; when finding their Guide thus wallowing in Wine, and not able to help himſelf, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pull'd him up, and carried him before the <hi>Bacha,</hi> who ſeeing him almoſt drown'd in Wine, condemn'd him as a Prophaner of the <hi>Moſque,</hi> and forbid him to mount the <hi>Minarés</hi> ever after: Nay, his Crime was ſo very odious to them, that they have aboliſh'd this manner of Calling the People to Prayers.

This Hall is large enough to hold an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, without reckoning either the Courtiers or Souldiers that attend every-where. It is open on three ſides: The Cieling is of Wood very well wrought and gilded; the Wainſcot at the bottom of the Room of very curious Workmanſhip, and the Walls every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where full of Painting; but which wants the Pencil of a skilful Artiſt, to regulate its Defects. The Cieling is ſupported by Twelve great Pillars in Relievo, gilded, which gives it a great Luſtre. This Hall is almoſt ſquare, and has little leſs than ſixty feet in length:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105141:30"/>It has in the middle a great Marble Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where its heighth does not hinder its having a Fountain continually play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the help of Pumps.</p>
               <p>There are three other Halls of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Palace, which are much larger and more magnificent than this; but becauſe I have only propos'd to my ſelf to give a ſhort view of theſe Matters, I ſhall paſs 'em by with the King's Houſes of Pleaſure, without any farther deſcription than that they are bewitching Places, and ſo very Noble, than nothing can come near 'em in all <hi>Aſia.</hi>

               <p>After the King,
<note place="margin">How the Gueſts are ſerv'd.</note> the Gueſts are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their turns with Rice, Boil'd and Roaſt Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in more than an Hundred and Fifty Gold Plates, with their Covers, which weigh twice as much: And every Plate is not leſs than a Foot and half Diameter. The <hi>Deſſers</hi> are ſerved alſo in Plates of Gold, but they begin always with Sweetmeats in Silver and Porcellain Veſſels. The Entertainment is ſerv'd up whilſt the King is giving Audience; and 'tis then that he gives Wine to the Lords of his Court. The Bottles and Cups they drink out of are alſo of Gold enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel'd, and ſet with Precious Stones. They are rank'd all about the Marble Baſon, which is in the middle of the Hall, and at whoſe corners are plac'd four ſmall Golden Casks, and four of Silver, each of which is about the weight of a Man. Theſe together with the Perfume and Flower Pots, which are alſo of Gold, make a very agreeable Symmetry.</p>
               <p>Before the Hall are plac'd in ſtate a great many Elephants, Lions, Tigers,
<note place="margin">The King's wild Beaſts where pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> Leopards, and other famous wild Beaſts, whoſe Chains and Nails that faſten 'em are of Gold: Every one of theſe Beaſts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105141:32"/>has before him two Ciſterns or Troughs alſo of Gold, in one of which is his Meat, and the other his Drink. But there is nothing more magnificent than the Eighteen Led-Horſes that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to view before this Hall. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Horſe of himſelf is worth a King's Ranſom. His Stirrups, Bridle, Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and the fore and hind part of his Saddle being all of Gold, garniſh'd with precious Stones: Alſo his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are altogether as rich, tho' they be very large. Some of theſe Harneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are garniſh'd with Diamonds,
<note place="margin">Horſes very richly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipp'd.</note> and others with Emeralds, Rubies, Saphires, very great Pearls, and all other ſort of Jewels of bigneſs and beauty equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprizing. Every Horſe has alſo before him two Ciſterns or Troughs of Gold to contain his Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Wild-Aſſes have been plac'd amongſt theſe Horſes: For a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miſſionary coming one day to Court to preſent a Letter from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was ſo much ſurprized to ſee Aſſes ſo richly accoutred, that he could not retain his Gravity, but began to laugh heartily: Inſomuch that an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer that perceiv'd him, went very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy up to him, and ask'd the occaſion.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105141:32"/>He anſwer'd, that he could not forbear when he ſaw Animals treated with ſuch diſtinction that would have been ſo much ſcorn'd and ridicul'd in <hi>Spain.</hi> To which the Officer wittily reply'd, <hi>That is becauſe Aſſes are more common in Your Country, but in Ours we eſteem them as they are more rare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King is ſeated croſs-leg'd at the lower end of the Hall on a rich Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card-Bed within gilded Baliſters,
<note place="margin">The King's Seat.</note> lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a noble Pillow, which there's none but he can have in <hi>Perſia:</hi> Nor is any Body elſe permitted to ſit after the ſame manner; but the other Lords always place themſelves on their Breech, that Poſture being lookt upon as more reſpectful. The Children of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> are always about him, two of 'em continually refreſhing him with long Fans made of Peacock's Tails. The reſt have all ſome Office near his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. One preſents him his Cup, the other his Tobacco, Coffee, and Tea, and a third the Baſon to waſh after he has eaten. The principal Eunuchs are alſo on each ſide of him; and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Arms make an Oblique Line from the lower part of his Throne to the two chief Columns of the Hall.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:105141:33"/>
               <p>The <hi>Etmadaulet</hi> is ſeated at the firſt Column on the Left-Hand,
<note place="margin">His Lords Seats.</note> which you muſt note is the principal place of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of his Armies on the Right.

<note place="margin">Muſicians Seats.</note> Their Muſick and Symphony continues during the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which always preceeds the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and which is done on purpoſe that the Gueſts may not hear what is ſaid to the King. The Fourty Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of Honour leaning upon their Staffs, make a Circle before him, which alſo hinders 'em from ſo much as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is done at Audiences.</p>

               <p>It ſeems the King, that he may make the luſtre of his Officers Habits appear the ſtronger and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, does the Office of a Shade in a Picture, and always affects to dreſs meanly, there being nothing but his Golden Feather out of the left ſide of his Turban, that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him by its precious Stones of great price.</p>
               <p>By what has been ſaid, it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> imitate the Magnificence of <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> in their Feaſts; but not the Temperance and Moderation that he always required at his.
<note place="margin">Grandees forc'd to drink, and wherefore.</note> Great Men are now a days forc'd to drink even to exceſs, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105141:35"/>has oftentimes diſagreeable Effects. Nevertheleſs the King orders it out of Policy; for Wine draws from 'em thoſe Truths they would have conceal'd had they been ſober. He does it alſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him; for one of his greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures conſiſts in ſeeing 'em carried out from his Table dead-drunk. He works 'em up to what degrees he pleaſes; for he makes 'em drink in a ſort of Goblet made in the faſhion of a Ladle, and which holds at leaſt a good <hi>Paris</hi> Pint: They call this ſort of Goblet <hi>Hazar-Pecha,</hi> that is, a thouſand Trades; for, they ſay, thoſe that empty it thrice, or four times, may eaſily run Diviſions upon a thouſand ſeveral Arts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. They give 'em nothing that might correct the Wine; for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways drink it at the time of Audiences, when there is nothing ſerv'd up but Sweetmeats and Fruits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Europeans</hi> who have the Honour to be call'd to theſe Feaſts, always find wherewithal to ſatisfie their Appetites; for every thing is exquiſite in its kind, and well order'd.
<note place="margin">Their way of Eating.</note> But they are often at a ſtand when they ſee they muſt eat Rice with their open Hands, and tear the boil'd and roſt with their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105141:35"/>for here you have neither Knives, Forks, nor Napkins: They give you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſort of Box-ſpoons; but they are to drink a certain Liquor made of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, boil'd Wine, and Verjuice, which you always drink with your Rice. If you would, you could not make uſe of 'em to eat, becauſe they are very large and deep, and therefore not to be taken into your Mouths.</p>
               <p>The Modeſty, Reſpect, and Diſcretion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Officers is to be wonder'd at, for they ſit all in a profound ſilence at the King's Table. Moreover, their Repaſts are generally ſo ſhort,
<note place="margin">Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty at theſe Feaſts</note> that they have not time to talk, if they were enclin'd (eating open-handed;) for ſcarce is the laſt Table ſerv'd, before the firſt is ready to be taken away.</p>
               <p>The Magnificence of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> appears the more glorious,
<note place="margin">How the King treats Strangers.</note> by reaſon of the great Number of foreign Princes that he entertains at his Court. The Son of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and many <hi>Usbeg</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces keep their Courts with him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at his Charge. Ambaſſadors, Envoys, and others that bring Letters from any Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> (which they confound all under the Names of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105141:36"/>Gueſts) are lodg'd and entertain'd by his ſole Bounty, and to whom he never grants Audiences of Leave, 'till he has made 'em Preſents of Silver brocard and Silk Stuffs, work'd in his Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturies. Alſo there is nothing more obliging,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His obliging manner of receiving Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</hi> &amp;c.</note> than the manner after which he receives 'em; for no ſooner are they arriv'd on the Confines, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the firſt Governour, that they bring Diſpatches to the King, from ſuch and ſuch Princes, but he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately provides 'em Horſes to mount themſelves and Followers, and furniſhes 'em moreover with Mules and Camels to carry their Baggage: And this all by the King's Orders, who ſends ſome of the Principal Officers to conduct 'em on to Court, with expreſs Commands to ſee 'em provided of all things neceſſary where ever they come. When they are arriv'd at the City where the King is, they place 'em in ſome Houſe in the Suburbs, and immediately go to give the King an account; which he no ſooner hears, but he receives 'em into the Number of his Gueſts, and orders the Introducer of Ambaſſadours, to bring 'em ſuch News on his behalf, to prepare 'em an Houſe richly furniſh'd,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105141:36"/>and therein to inrroduce 'em with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Introducer immediately goes to ſalute 'em, and after mutual Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, takes an account of the number of their Retinue, and accordingly haſtens away to acquaint the King, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns 'em all ſuitable Maintenance. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the Introducer goes to 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and conducts 'em to their Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prepar'd for 'em. He provides 'em alſo a certain number of Guards, to prevent any Affronts might be offer'd 'em. He lays 'em in all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for one Month, and ſo continues every new Moon as long as they ſtay. He makes 'em frequent Viſits, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf of their Health, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for any thing, that he might inform the King. He alſo conducts 'em to all Publick Audiences and Feaſts, where they have a proper Place aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd 'em. They are honour'd and reſpected where ever they come; and it would be to wound the King in his tendereſt Part, to affront or give the leaſt cauſe of Diſcontent to any of his Gueſts. He has a great deal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard towards 'em, and defrays their Charges when they return, as well as when they come to his Court.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105141:37"/>

                  <note place="margin">A fine Courſe.</note> ſpar'd no coſt to adorn it with magnificent Palaces, Houſes of Pleaſure, and noble Walks; and amongſt the reſt, that fine Courſe he planted between the New and Old City, is one of the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching: 'Tis a Walk very ſtreight and uniform, more than two hundred Geometrical feet broad, and two good <hi>French</hi> Leagues long.
<note place="margin">Its Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> It is ſet on each ſide with a great number of Plane-Trees, which are large, high, and ſpreading; and whoſe Leaves being of the bigneſs of thoſe of a Vine, make a very agreeable Shade. This Courſe beginning at the declining of the Mountain <hi>Sofa,</hi> is made round; ſo that the Fountain which is in the middle, throws its Spouts agreeably on all ſides, into great eight corner'd Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as large as Ponds; which receiving their Force with regret, returns 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral other Baſons, at three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces diſtance one from another, which muſt needs be thought to make a very pleaſant Sight. Between the ſpaces of theſe Baſons, are the King's Royal Houſes on both ſides of the Walk, one over againſt another; they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105141:38"/>are built after the ſame manner, and their Structure is both commodious and magnificent. They have many Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, diſtinguiſh'd by Balconies, and which advance upon the Courſe: Their Fronts are embelliſh'd with Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and enrich'd with Leaves and Flowers of Gold, in <hi>demi Relievo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Walk is croſs'd by another, leſs both in length and breadth,

               <p>The River <hi>Zendroud</hi> cuts the Courſe a little below the Walk:
<note place="margin">A fine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> The Chanel of this River is very large, and would be much more did not the Gravel, which it brings from the Mountains where it has its Source, many times hinder its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing; but nevertheleſs it has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gain'd ground, and made it ſelf an advanc'd Shore. 'Tis a very fine River during the Winter; but being the only one that ſerves the Plain of <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> they cut ſo many Drains out of it to water their Lands, that in Summer it is almoſt quite dry. 'Tis a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105141:38"/>great matter of diſpute what becomes of its Waters in the Summer: Some ſay they are loſt in thoſe Drains about the City of <hi>Yezd,</hi> others, that they are ſwallow'd up in a Hole there, whoſe End is not known; for their Streams are not to be trac'd any farther.</p>
               <p>The River of <hi>Zendroud</hi> thus not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able in Summer to ſupply with Water the vaſt Plain of <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> the King had a deſign to give it Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with <hi>Ab-Couran,</hi> which is a great River, ſeparated from it only by a little Mountain about ten or twelve Leagues above <hi>Iſpahan.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Enginier, undertook to join 'em, and had taken his Meaſures accordingly, either to cut an Hole through it, or to divide it by way of Mines; but <hi>Chiek Alikan,</hi> who was then Chief Miniſter, oppos'd this Deſign, becauſe the Country about <hi>Iſpahan</hi> would have then become ſo fertile, that he ſhould have been depriv'd of the great Rents he receiv'd from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Kermoucha,</hi> where he had a great number of Villages; and from the Government of <hi>Hamadan;</hi> which two generally ſupplied this Country with Corn, when they wanted.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105141:39"/>Lord had ſo prevailing an Authority above the Intereſt of the State, that he perſwaded the King the Waters of <hi>Ab-Couran</hi> were not good, and therefore would utterly ſpoil thoſe of <hi>Zendroud.</hi> Some other Lords were engag'd in the ſame Intereſts, and therefore vigorouſly ſupported this Opinion, inſomuch as they eaſily prevail'd to baffle this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Great Maſter of the Houſhold, the Great Maſter of the Wardrobe, the Great Maſter of the Horſe, and the Great Gentleman Carver, with their ſeveral Officers; a great many Led-Horſes come after them richly accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; then come the Officers of the <hi>Sophi's,</hi> with the Uſhers of the Palace, who carry every one an Axe; after theſe the Introducer of Ambaſſadours; Then the fourty Stewards of Honour go before the Great Maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, who marches alone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Diſorders and Obſtacles in the way. Then follow the Pages and Children of the <hi>Haram</hi> on Horſe-back well mounted; next the <hi>Umbrella</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and he that prepares the King's Tobacco follow theſe Pages. Laſtly, the Chief Eunuch goes immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, who marches in the middle of Twelve Footmen, and who always allows the Honour to any of his Miniſters to diſcourſe with him upon

They give no Quarter to any Men they meet on the Road, nor even to Boys that are paſt ſeven years old, if they ſurprize 'em in the Roads that are guarded; they puniſh them as ſeverely as if they were Traytors, for daring to attempt any Glances on thoſe that the King holds ſo dear.

               <p>The Fifth is of the <hi>Kaurs Yſaouls,</hi> who are the Meſſengers on Horſe-back. They make Two Thouſand Men; whoſe Captain is the Great Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

                  <note place="margin">Number of Troops to guard the Frontiers.</note> 12000 Men in the Province of <hi>Candahar,</hi> which confines with the Great <hi>Mogul;</hi> 20000 in <hi>Koraſſan,</hi> which borders with the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Balk, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara,</hi> and <hi>Samarkand;</hi> 15000 in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandran</hi> and <hi>Guilan,</hi> which border with the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpian</hi> Sea; 12000 at <hi>Derband</hi> and <hi>Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> which confine with the ſame People: And alſo a great number at <hi>Circaſſia, Georgia,</hi> and <hi>Colchide;</hi> 20000 in <hi>Media,</hi> whoſe Upper part confines

<note place="margin">Number of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> together with the King's Guards, make no leſs than an Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Men, without comprehending the Gariſons of Cities which are in the Heart of the Kingdom. They are all provided for out of the Demeſns, and confiſcated Eſtates. By this we may judge what prodigious Army the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> is able to have on foot upon any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſion. He has little or no Infantry, becauſe they could not ſupport the Fatigues of Deſarts and Mountains, which <hi>Perſia</hi> is all over full of.
<note place="margin">No Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and wherefore.</note> And they make uſe of little or no Artillery for the ſame reaſon; for they have no need of it to defend their Towns, which have neither Walls nor Fortifications, and therefore muſt truſt wholy to their Bodies. Alſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105141:52"/>none of the Caſtles on the Frontiers could ever be able to reſiſt. The Fuſiliers I ſpoke of before, are never on Foot, but when they guard the King at home; for when they accompany him to the Wars, they are always mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> Battles are never regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
<note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fighting.</note> They throw themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Enemy in round Bodies. They ſhoot their Arrows, and then retire; but it is dangerous to purſue 'em, for they are very dextrous at levelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them,
<note place="margin">Their Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems.</note> tho' they are flying upon full ſpeed. They are ſubtle, and know when to engage an Enemy, where they can divert the Water, and ſo make 'em periſh with Thirſt. They are alſo very cunning at flying to Ambuſcades, where they can cut their Enemy to pieces. Their Horſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, for they can clime thoſe places? where a Footman would be ſcarce able to paſs.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> has no Forces by Sea,
<note place="margin">No Forces by Sea.</note> and he only reſerves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Soveraignty over the Gulf of <hi>Ormus,</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Caſpian</hi> Seas. His Subjects don't love Navigation; for they have it in ſo great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that they call thoſe <hi>Nacoda's,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:105141:52"/>that is, <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who expoſe their Lives upon ſo inconſtant in Element. This no doubt extreamly pleaſes the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> who have all the Commerce by Sea of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>'Tis a great Advantage to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to have ſo numerous an Army at his command, but much greater to have it in the power of his Treaſury to augment it as far as he pleaſes. His Treaſure which his Father left him has been very much encreas'd ſince his coming to the Crown; for I believe above Twenty Years, there has never a Day paſt but there has come into his Exchequer 50000 Livres.
<note place="margin">Preſent Treaſury augmented</note> This is enough (without doubt) to govern his Kingdom quietly, and to augment it, if he pleaſes, by new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And nothing, that I know of, hinders him to put 'em in Execution but his ſingular Goodneſs: For his Power is abſolute over his Subjects, who are all almoſt Slaves; his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are Skilfull and Active, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors great Politicians, and well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd; and his Soldiers valiant.</p>
               <p>I believe there is not in all the World a more abſolute Deſpotick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that of <hi>Perſia:</hi>

I'll give you one Example in the Perſon of <hi>Abdel Kaſſamkan,</hi> Governour of the City of <hi>Hamadan,</hi> Metropolis of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in the Kingdom of <hi>Media.</hi> This Lord having obtain'd this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by his Merit, and of which he had given ſufficient proofs in the charge of <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> which he had executed Nine Years, incurr'd the King's diſpleaſure, upon a falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Merchant, employ'd by his Enemies to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The King immediately diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Yſaoul</hi> or Meſſenger to command him to Court.

Then the <hi>Kan</hi> throwing his Turban upon the Ground, offer'd him alſo his Head: But the Meſſenger told him, that his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders extended only to the ſeizing of his Perſon and Goods. Which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der having given to the <hi>Vizier,</hi> or King's Lieutenant to read, he immediately enter'd his <hi>Haram,</hi> ſeiz'd upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found, and drove out his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after a very ſhameful manner. thus his Houſe being pillaged, and all his Goods confiſcated, he was led bound to Court, after the rudeſt and moſt ignominious manner imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He remain'd there Nine Years as a private Perſon, without either E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage or Retinue, and without ever daring to appear before his Prince. But at length Fortune began to change in his favour,
<note place="margin">He is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Ruine of his Enemy.</note> and the Conſtable, who was the cauſe of his Misfortune, fell himſelf into a deeper Diſgrace, whoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105141:54"/>tragical Circumſtances are but too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable not to relate.</p>
               <p>This Conſtable's name was <hi>Sarou Kan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tragical end of the Conſtable.</note> who over and above the charge of this Office, had alſo the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Money, and of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Provinces of <hi>Hamadan, Cazran,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</note> and <hi>Sambran.</hi> The firſt blow that made him ſtagger was given by the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Kermoncha,</hi> Son of the laſt <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> who complain'd to the King, that the Lieutenant of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable at <hi>Hamadan</hi> ſacrific'd to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prejudice his Maſter always had towards his Father, the Lives and juſteſt Intereſts of all the Lords of his Race, who were very numerous in that Province: And the better to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Accuſation, he produc'd the Proceedings of the Maſſacre of the principal of his Family, word for word. The Conſtable preſently began to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf in denying the Fact; but the King having referr'd the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Matter to the Great Maſter of his Houſhould, told the Conſtable, That if he were convicted, His and his Lieutenant's Head alone ſhould not ſuffice to revenge ſo much Innocent Blood.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:105141:54"/>
               <p>The Second Blow was upon account of the Money he had Superintendance over;
<note place="margin">Second Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</note> for he was accuſed of great Miſdemeanors in that Office, and of having put the whole Kingdom into diſorder. The King for this began to reprehend him with a great deal of heat: Whereupon he had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to retort, and tell his Majeſty, He knew not what ſort of King he was, to believe ſo eaſily the Malice and Calumnies of his Enemies. This ſo nettled our Monarch, that the Death of this Lord had undoubtedly enſued his Diſpleaſure, had not the <hi>Etmadaulet</hi> fell on his Knees, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beg'd his Life.</p>

<note place="margin">Occaſion of his Ruine.</note> The ſudden return of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla Sultan,</hi> Son to the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Merva,</hi> from the Country of the <hi>Usbeg Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> where he was Priſoner, was the unavoidable occaſion of the final ruine of this Conſtable. This <hi>Sultan,</hi> who has been always acknowledged to be one of the moſt valiant Captains in all <hi>Perſia,</hi> having receiv'd Orders Three Years before to go to defend the Caſtle of <hi>Mourg-ab</hi> againſt the <hi>Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs,</hi> who were come to beſiege it, parted from <hi>Hiſpahan</hi> with 300 Horſe,

But ſcarce was he got to <hi>Mourg-ab,</hi> but he was inveſted with Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Uſbegs:</hi> Whereupon he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſpatch'd a Courier to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Herat,</hi> to ſend him inſtant Supplies. But this Governour, who was a ſworn Enemy of the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Merva</hi>'s, being glad of this occaſion of ruining the <hi>Sultan</hi> his Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd theſe Couriers without giving them any Anſwer.

The Conſtable alſo being unwilling to yield in Treachery to the Governour, writ to his Son the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Sambran,</hi> to prevent any of his Troops going to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla Sultan;</hi> and alſo commanded him to ſend a Letter to the Prince of the <hi>Usbegs,</hi> written by him, to the ſame effect as that of the Governours. The <hi>Sultan</hi> finding his ſtay vain, and being unwilling to diſoblige his Prince with Delays, which might ſeem the effect of Cowardice rather than Neceſſity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his Charge without ſo much as ſeeing the King.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:105141:56"/>
               <p>In the mean time,
<note place="margin">A famous Siege.</note> the <hi>Usbegs</hi> preſs'd on vigorouſly the Siege of <hi>Mourg-ab,</hi> and <hi>Abdulla Sultan</hi> defended himſelf with no leſs Courage than he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd; for having loſt all hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he was reſolv'd to die as bravely as he could: He arm'd as many of the Inhabitants as were able, with whom he made ſeveral ſucceſsful Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But this Advantage over the <hi>Usbegs</hi> did not procure him any long Quiet; for they having receiv'd a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eight thouſand Men, puſh'd the Siege on with greater Vigour than before. Whereupon <hi>Abdulla</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Recruits, attempted a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sally; where being over-power'd with Numbers, he was forc'd to retreat with the total loſs of the City, and ſhut himſelf up in the Caſtle:
<note place="margin">The Revolt of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sultan.</note> But ſcarce was he enter'd there, when the Gariſon and Inhabitants being tired with ſo long a Siege, and not ſeeing any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours come to their aſſiſtance, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately revolted againſt him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Enemy. Thus <hi>Abdulla Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> ſeeing all Hopes loſt, hearken'd to no Motives but thoſe of extream Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> have all of their Wives,
<note place="margin">His ſtrange Reſolutions.</note> and by which he thought to ſave his from Infamy: He therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105141:56"/>to repreſent to her, that the Caſtle was irrecoverably loſt, and that ſhe was in danger of being diſhonour'd by the mortal Enemies both of her Nation and Religion.
<note place="margin">His Wife ſtabs her ſelf. His Siſter alſo.

The <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Siſter follow'd her barbarous Example; but his only Son, who was yet too young for ſuch an Action, had his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's inhuman Help to diſpatch him; for ſnatching the Ponyard all reeking with Blood out of his Siſter's Breaſt, he plung'd it into this innocent Youth's Heart, chuſing rather by a falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of Honour to murther his own Son, than to ſuffer him to be led a Captive with equal danger, by the Enemies of his Prince and Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſeen the total Extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tragical End of his Family, there was nothing more remain'd but that he ſhould think of dying himſelf: Whereupon ruſhing with fury into the thickeſt of his Enemies, he made no ſmall havock of 'em with his Scymiter; but tho' he expos'd himſelf to ſo many, yet he did not meet with that Death his Deſpair ſought after; for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd with their Force, he at length

               <p>The Rigours of this Slavery did not wholly appeaſe the Hatred of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in <hi>Perſia;</hi> for the Conſtable, who had then altogether the King's Ear, employ'd the Misfortunes of the Son, for the Ruine of the Father; and to that purpoſe gave ſo ſudden and ſubtile a Turn to the taking of <hi>Mourg-ab,</hi> that the King laid all the fault of this ill ſucceſs upon the Father of <hi>Abdulla Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> whom he immediately depriv'd of his Governments of <hi>Merva</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouchak.</hi>

               <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>Abdulla Sultan</hi> was not without ſome Conſolation in his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; for <hi>Sepan Kouli</hi> Prince of the <hi>Usbegs,</hi> having no ordinary ſenſe of his Valour, us'd him well, and endeavour'd many times in vain to engage him to his Service; but promiſing him his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, if he could end that War ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which he then had with the

                  <hi>Kalmouch Tartars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Enemy's Army.</note> he at length prevail'd upon him to accept the Command of his Army; which he knew ſo well how to manage, that he quickly recover'd all the Slaves and Country that they had taken from this Prince;
<note place="margin">He conquers and obiains his Liberty.</note> wherewithal the <hi>Usbeg</hi> Monarch was ſo well ſatisfied, that he kept his Word, and gave him his Freedom. And to convince him the better of his Reſpect, he deliver'd into his hands the Conſtable and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Herat</hi>'s Letters, which had been the only cauſe of the loſs of <hi>Mourg-ab,</hi> the Maſſacre of his Family, and his own Captivity.</p>
               <p>Thus being prepar'd for Revenge, he poſted immediately to Court, where he underſtood his Father had fallen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo under his Enemies Ill-will;
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">Diſcovers the Intrigue</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſtable was a Man of all the World that knew beſt how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<note place="margin">Condition of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable at Court.</note>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:105141:58"/>his Tongue; the King lov'd him ſo extreamly well, that he paſt by thoſe things in him, that would have been capital Crimes in others: He was ſo well ſetled in his Prince's Favour, that he eaſily parry'd all the Thruſts were offer'd at him, upon the account of the Money-Miſdemeanour, and his Cruelty againſt thoſe of the Family of the late <hi>Etmadaulet;</hi> and moreover, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this unexpected arrival of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he was greater in favour than ever.</p>
               <p>'Tis true,
<note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> he had all the neceſſary Charms requir'd in a Courtier, to make himſelf belov'd by his Prince; His Air was Noble, and Manners ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly obliging; his Shape tall, and well-proportion'd; in ſhort, he was the fineſt Lord of all the Court.
<note place="margin">His Wit.</note> But the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Wit far excell'd thoſe of his Body; his Diſcourſe was always enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, eloquent, inſinuating, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel; and he could write in Verſe or Proſe as polite as any body. He knew how to manage his Talents ſo well, that he was look'd upon to be the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, diſcreet Lord of all the Court. But nevertheleſs the King made him ſometimes drink, to hear him cenſure and rally the reſt of the Courtiers; and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105141:58"/>it was then that he could ſay or do any thing; yet ne'er a one of 'em all was in a Condition high enough to revenge himſelf. He was at this pitch of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, when the <hi>Sultan</hi> came to Court; yet however he was ſuddenly forc'd to yield to a ſtrange Turn of Affairs:
<note place="margin">His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> His ſecret Enemies that he had at Court, were for the moſt part the Eunuchs, whom he had not the diſcretion to ſpare in his Railleries, inſomuch that they were not only contented to ſupport his Accuſations againſt him, but took alſo occaſion to diſcover to the King another Intrigue of his, which alone was ſufficient to ruin him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mariam Kanum,</hi> the King's Aunt, remaining a Widow ſome time after the <hi>Sadre</hi> her Husband's death, ſhe at laſt fell in love with the Conſtable, who it ſeems had not Prudence enough to prevent the Miſeries that Intrigues with Princeſſes of the Blood bring a Man into; for he yielded to her Paſſion, and they ſome time deceived the Vigilance of the Eunuchs about her: But the Jealouſie of his Wives encreaſing by his frequent abſence, they at laſt diſcover'd the whole Plot, and gave immediate notice to the Eunuchs; who not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105141:59"/>to diſcover it to the King, becauſe of the Conſtable's being ſo great a Favourite, they were now reſolv'd not to loſe ſo plauſible an occaſion, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the whole matter.</p>
               <p>The King,
<note place="margin">The King's Cunning.</note> who has always been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted very cunning, was reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Reſentments, till he had heard from the Princeſs's own Mouth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had any love for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable; and to that purpoſe caus'd her immediately to be call'd into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where after a great deal of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he at laſt acquainted her with the great Reſpect and Eſteem he had for her, and therefore was reſolv'd ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to re-marry her: Whereupon he began to propoſe to her many of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; but ſhe ſhew'd for 'em all an equal Diſlike, till at laſt coming to the Conſtable, he told her, he ſhould have propos'd him before, but that he thought he was too much in years for her Embraces: Whereupon ſhe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to conceal her Love, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately told the King, that his Age was beſt ſuitable with hers; and moreover began to run on in ſuch a long harangue in his Commendations, that the King had no more reaſon to doubt of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105141:59"/>truth of what had been told him. Wherefore diſmiſſing her, he made her believe he would ſpeedily beſtow her upon the Conſtable; and ſo bid her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, whilſt he diſpos'd of all things for the Nuptials. She being infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd and pleas'd, kiſs'd his Feet, and ſo departed.</p>
               <p>So ſawcy an Attempt upon the Royal Bloud, and the Treaſon diſcover'd by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> were more than was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ruin the Conſtable: But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the King calling in his Eunuchs again, they did not ceaſe to augment the Diſturbance of his Mind, by telling him, That the Intrigues the Conſtable had with his Aunt, might in time amount to dethroning him: And, That they thought they had reaſon to believe he deſign'd to place the Crown on his Majeſty's eldeſt Son's Head, who was Two and twenty Years old. I know no more of the Particulars of this Conſpiracy, but that the young Prince was not ſuffer'd to live to ſucceed his Father.</p>
               <p>The King being extreamly incens'd with theſe Relations, diſpatch'd away Three Couriers immediately to <hi>Herat,</hi> with expreſs Orders to bring him the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105141:60"/>Head of the Governour; but Death had prevented their Deſign, for he died three Days before. Next the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Conſtable's Son to be arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted at <hi>Sembran,</hi> and the Lieutenants of <hi>Kazran</hi> and <hi>Hamadan.</hi> All theſe Orders were ſecretly executed by the Eunuchs, without either the knowledge of the <hi>Etmadaulet</hi> of Council. And all the Lords were extreamly ſurpriz'd, when they receiv'd Orders at midnight to come to the Palace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> the <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> and the <hi>Superintendant</hi> of the <hi>Slaves,</hi> appear'd the firſt before the King, being the Four Principal Officers of the Crown, when the King, not ſo much as affording one favourable Look to the Conſtable, gave him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a ſurprizing Proſpect of his Misfortunes, which was augmented the more, when he ſaw the Guards rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd with Two hundred Eunuchs in Arms about the King's Perſon. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he endeavour'd to conceal his Concern, and took his ordinary Place next to the <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> to whom the King had given Wine, and to two other Lords; but took no notice of the Conſtable; which the Superintendant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105141:60"/>of the Slaves (being the King's great Favourite) obſerving, expreſs'd the Effects of Wonder in his Looks, and which gave the King occaſion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Diſcourſe to him in theſe Words: <hi>You ſeem ſurpriz'd</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I take no greater notice of this Traytor; but that you may know I can do all things in due time, I command you inſtantly to riſe, and to go cut off his Head.</hi> This Lord being frighted with ſo ſtrange a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, immediately caſt himſelf at the King's Feet; but inſtead of obtaining Mercy for his Friend, he got only the Privilege of being a Companion in his Condemnation: For the King being nettled with his Diſobedience, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly commanded the <hi>Divan Begui</hi> to out off both their Heads. But the <hi>Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madaulet</hi> a little intercepting, fell on his Knees, and with his ordinary Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence having repreſented to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, That the Conſtable might well be thought criminal, in being the firſt occaſion of diſpleaſing ſo merciful a Prince: But for the Superintendant of the Slaves, he took only an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Liberty of interceeding for his Friend, without acting any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Reſpect that was due to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105141:61"/>his Commands; for that all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had confirmed that Law, which forbid any one to execute ſuch Orders as this, till they had been reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thrice; and that knowing of what importance it was to oppoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an humble Interceſſion to their Anger, they have always allow'd of ſolliciting their Clemency in favour of the Accus'd. <hi>Very well then</hi> (ſays the King) <hi>I pardon the Superintendant of the Slaves: But you,</hi> Divan Begui, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you thrice go execute my Orders; go inſtantly and ſtrike off that Traytors's Head.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> though very unwillingly, was forc'd to go and ſeize the Conſtable, and to degrade him, by ſnatching off his Turban, and throwing it on the ground, when drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him out of the Hall, he took off his Girdle, and bound his Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: The Conſtable all the while wiſhing Proſperity and long Life to the King, without daring to murmur any Complaints againſt his Uſage; and to ſhew his entire Submiſſion to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Orders, he often kiſs'd the <hi>Divan Begui's</hi> Robe, and conjur'd him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to pay his Debts, and not to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105141:61"/>extend his Wrath to the reft of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, they being altogether innocent, and he only guilty. Then he deſired the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to pray in, and to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his laſt Hour were yet come, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping always the King's Anger would mitigate. But the <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> fearing by delay to incenſe the King farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, fix'd the laſt Minute of his Life, by diſcharging a Stroke into his Neck, which through Grief to ſee his Friend in that Condition, was not ſtrong enough to do his Buſineſs; wherefore the Conſtable entreating by their ancient Friendſhip to diſpatch him, the <hi>Divan Begui</hi> not being farther able himſelf, caus'd his Gentleman to come up, who with three Blows of a Scymetar, ſever'd his Head from his Body. Which done, it was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry'd to the King; who looking upon it with a ſtern Countenance, cried, <hi>Very well, Traytor: Am I now aſleep? Am I now in a Lethargy, as you ſent word to my Enemies? No, no; you find I am not.</hi> Then ordering the Head to be taken from him, he turn'd himſelf to the Lords of his Court, and told 'em, That <hi>that Head was but the Firſt of Four that ſhould fall.</hi> Which ſurprizing

               <p>The Wedding that the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Princeſs his Aunt, was by theſe means chang'd into a bloody and frightful Tragedy; for he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order'd an Eunuch to carry her the Conſtable's Head; and moreover to acquaint her from him, that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Husband he had made choice of for her, and that it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhe had yet made no attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon. Nevertheleſs he ſhould not be contented by puniſhing her only with Griefs to ſee her Lover's Head in a Platter, he would alſo have her's for reparation.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Executions were doing in the Palace, the Great Maſter of the Houſhold, and Governour of <hi>Shiras</hi> were ſealing of the Conſtable's Houſe. The King terminated theſe tragical Actions by giving the Government of <hi>Hamadan</hi> to <hi>Abdelkſum-Kan,</hi> who had been diſpoſſeſt thereof Eight Years before by the Wiles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable: But the King, tho' he reſtor'd him his Government, yet kept his Goods, which he had confiſcated and united to his Demeſns. This ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105141:62"/>Authority that makes the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> Unaccountable, at the ſame time renders his Subjects Miſerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chiek Sephi,</hi> reſtorer of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and who rais'd its Power to that height we ſee it in at preſent, was, without doubt, an excellent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician.
<note place="margin">Original of the King's Deſpotick Power.</note> He knew how to make uſe of the Advantages he had by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the greateſt part of the <hi>Medians</hi> came in Crowds to embrace. He had immediately a Reputation of being a Saint of that Law, his Life being very regular and retir'd. Upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he had leiſure to invent a great many Improbable Revelations; but which, nevertheleſs, he put off to the People for Oracles. In ſhort, he knew ſo well how to manage their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with his Hypocriſy,
<note place="margin">He is Head of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> that he made 'em acknowledge his Son <hi>Cha Iſhmael</hi> for the Sovereign and Supream Head of their Religion. Inſomuch that the ſucceeding Kings have retain'd this Power and Advantage. For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorantly believe,
<note place="margin">His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him Infallible.</note> That being deſcended from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they are always faultleſs in their Manners, and infallible in their Deciſions. In a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105141:63"/>that the Emperor of <hi>Perſia</hi> holds in his Hands, both the Reins of Spiritual and Temporal Authority, which are the Two only Foundations that can ſupport an Arbitrary Power.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> are ſo pre-poſſeſs'd and bigotted with the Infallibility of their Prince, that they receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Ordinances as Oracles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Heaven.
<note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Commands.</note> And however innocent a Perſon in diſgrace is, yet they look upon him as a Traytor and a Villain: Being of Opinion, That to incurr the diſpleaſure of their Prince is one of the moſt enormous of Crimes. 'Tis therefore they always treat 'em like <hi>Cain,</hi> with the terms of <hi>Traytor, Ingrate,</hi> and <hi>unworthy to ſee the Light,</hi> it being not poſſible to enter into their Heads, That the King can ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any Body without juſt Cauſe.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual Power is to be remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all the Addreſſes and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they have to and with him: As <hi>Kourban Olim</hi> (which is) May I be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd for you. <hi>Din Imanum Padicha,</hi> My King, my Saint, my Law! <hi>Bachan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha Dunim,</hi> May I turn about your Head.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:105141:63"/>
               <p>This way of expreſſing themſelves, <hi>May I turn about your Head,</hi> is not of modern Invention, but was in uſe with the ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, and it is practiſed now in ſo particular and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent a manner, that it cannot well be paſt by. For when the King beſtows any charge, he to whom it is given takes his Inſtalment by turning thrice about his Perſon, and ſaying, <hi>May I turn about your Head;</hi> and afterwards by falling on his Knees, and kiſſing his Majeſty's Feet. He proteſts by this Ceremony, That he is ready to expoſe his Life for the ſafety of his Maſters, and acknowledges withal, that his and his Family's dependance is altogether upon his Pleaſure; and 'tis therefore they call their King <hi>Veli Nahmet,</hi> that is, The Maſter and Diſtributer of Favours.</p>
               <p>All things are well order'd in the King's Privy-Council:

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105141:65"/>by his Ambaſſadors at his coming to the Crown: And as for the hopes of Advantages by this League, the King knew none more prevailing than to keep his Word given to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> and to live in Peace with him. The Arch-Biſhop Reply'd, That the <hi>Turks</hi> had but too often broke their Words with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that they never made ſo many Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to violate the Faith of Treaties.

               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſador repreſented, That there was a very favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from the <hi>Turks</hi> the Cities of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora, Bagdat,</hi> and <hi>Erzerom.</hi> But he was anſwer'd, That thoſe places were not more important to the <hi>Perſians</hi> than <hi>Caminiec</hi> was to the <hi>Poles;</hi> and that when they could take one, they would take the other.</p>
               <p>The Envoy of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> ſhew'd how great a Confuſion the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was in, and how eaſie a matter it was to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105141:65"/>Ruine him: <hi>Let him be humbled a God's Name,</hi> ſays the <hi>Etmadaulet, but let him not be ruin'd: He is a potent Neighbour ('tis true) and one that often incommodes us, but we ſhould be leſs able to endure a Prince of another Religion.

In this Council are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd the moſt important Affairs of State. The chief Miniſter, and the other Lords know nothing of what is tranſacted there. Theſe Eunuchs are Men of Wit, and the King always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon their fidelity.</p>
               <p>The Governour of the Princes is an Eunuch:
<note place="margin">They enjoy the Chief Offices.</note> Their Tutors are Eunuchs: The Affairs of the Kingdom are in the

In fine, they are all Eunuchs who have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing in the King's Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Royal Treaſure is confided in an Eunuch, as well as the Royal Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, with all other Rareties which are preſented to the King: And they have this reaſon for their Truſt, That theſe Eunuchs being bought Children out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and who know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, Father or Mother, nor have any Families to raiſe, they will be the likelier to be more Faithful and Honeſt: Beſides, theſe gainful Offices are beſtowed upon them becauſe the King is their Heir, and whatever they heap up is ſure to come again into his Treaſury. The King does nothing in the Council of his Revenue, without the knowledge of this Eunuch, who is the keeper of it.</p>

               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> is ſo very large,
<note place="margin">A good Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> that the moſt diſtant <hi>Kans</hi> might very well diſturb the State, if they were allow'd to be altogether Maſters of their Soldiers: But this probable diſorder has been prevented by placing in every Province a <hi>Vizier,</hi> or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, which does the ſame thing in <hi>Perſia</hi> as the Intendant in <hi>France,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that they are not allow'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Juſtice as they do, but are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſſiſtants to the <hi>Kans,</hi> who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the proper Judges in their own Provinces. Theſe <hi>Viziers</hi> raiſe the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Pay upon the Demeſns, that the <hi>Kans</hi> might not have the power to engage 'em to a Revolt. They have alſo care that the Peaſants, to avoid the hard Uſages of the <hi>Kans,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers, do not forſake their Labour. The <hi>Kalentar,</hi> or Provoſt of the Merchants, has alſo authority to prevent the abuſing of Merchants, and other Tradeſmen. And the Deputies
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105141:67"/>of the <hi>Sadre, Chiek Aliſlam,</hi> and the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi> are as ſo many Spies to obſerve the Proceedings of the <hi>Kan,</hi> and who can ſcarce do any thing without their Privity.

               <p>Nevertheleſs,
<note place="margin">Hazara to oppreſs his Subjects.</note> it is no common ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to oppreſs any of this King's Subjects, for he has ſo great a love for them, that he ſeverely puniſhes thoſe Governours that do but offend 'em; but yet he is not always right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd of their conduct. The Lords of his Councel are all provided of ſome Government; whoſe Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are alſo ſubject to the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards with their Governours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe employ their Intereſts as ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly for them as themſelves, for fear their Extortions being diſcover'd, might prove a prejudice to their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and great Expences at Court, which are altogether ſupply'd by theſe means: So that providing there be no falling out between the Governours, their Oppreſſions and Injuſtice can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be known.</p>
               <p>A difference ariſing between the Chief Miniſter and the Conſtable in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105141:68"/>1685, was the cauſe of a Brother of the latter's ruine: For the Conſtable, who ow'd his own Riſe to this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, inſinuated himſelf ſo much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his Favour, that he obtain'd the Government of <hi>Sembran</hi> for his Brother <hi>Mahmed Reza Kan.</hi> But this new Governour, who might have been one of the greateſt Men in <hi>Perſia,</hi> had he had ſo much Goodneſs and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty as Wit, began to exerciſe ſo many Inhumanities and Oppreſſions in that Province, that the People came to Court in Crowds for redreſs. They carried their Accuſations firſt to the Chief Miniſter, who ſending for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, acquainted him with the many Complaints were made againſt his Brother, and deſir'd him to uſe means to prevent the like for the future, for fear of the ill Conſequences that would certainly enſue, if they ſhould come to the King's Ear. So great a kindneſs as this from a Perſon that had a power of diſtributing Juſtice himſelf, one would have thought might have prevail'd upon this Conſtable, but the favour he imagin'd he was in with the King, over balanc'd all other Conſiderations, and therefore blinded
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105141:69"/>with Ambition, he gave him ſuch an Anſwer as was the utter ruine of his Brother, and in a great meaſure of himſelf. For he told this Miniſter, That it was not ſo great a wonder if his Brother, who was a young Man had ruin'd a Province, when he that was ſo conſummated a Politician had done the like for all <hi>Perſia.</hi> This Conſtable forgot all the while he ow'd his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to this Man, and who had as great a power to ſuppreſs his Pride, as he had had to advance it. In ſhort, the <hi>Etmadaulet</hi> inform'd the King of all, and this Governour of <hi>Sembran</hi> was immediately degraded, and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate confiſcated to the People's uſe, to make 'em amends for their loſs. He was forthwith ſent to <hi>Hiſpahan,</hi> and there laid in Irons: He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo many blows on the Feet as made his Nails jump off from 'em; and he never had eſcap'd a ſhameful death, if the Conſtable, who was alſo out of favour upon this occaſion, had not found out ſome means to appeaſe the angry <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> and moreover diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd Twenty Thouſand Crowns to make the People full ſatisfaction. He ſaved his Brother's Head by theſe means,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105141:69"/>but he was never able to re-eſtabliſh him in any Employ, or the King's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who would never ſo much as look upon him ever afterwards.</p>
               <p>The People may alſo preſent Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the <hi>Kans</hi> by way of the <hi>Etmadaulet,</hi> or <hi>Divan-Begui;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petitions preſented, how.</note> but theſe ways are full as chargeable, and often of as great difficulty as the former. For if the <hi>Kans,</hi> Complained againſt, are Friends either to one or other of theſe great Lords; or if they be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a better Reputation than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, they will be ſure to have theſe Petitions ſecretly ſent 'em. And, if not ſo, the Suppliant muſt enter into a Recognizance to the King, conformable to the importance of the matter, to be inſtantly paid, if he has falſly accus'd the <hi>Kan.</hi> The <hi>Etmadau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> and <hi>Divan-Begui,</hi> affix their Seals to this Recognizance; and then it muſt be enter'd in Five ſeveral Regiſters, where there are great Duties to be paid. After that the Suppliant carries it to the <hi>Divan-Begui,</hi> who grants out a Commiſſion to ſome Lord of that Province to examine into the Affair, and then he allows the Suppliant a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Palace to do Execution,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105141:70"/>and levy the Recognizance. Afterwards he carries it to the Chancery, where the Keeper of the Seals ſends him into the <hi>Haram,</hi> to get the King's Seal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. Then the Suppliant departs with his Meſſenger, whoſe Charges he is oblig'd to defray 'till he has made good what he pretended.

                  </note> For having made a Treaty with the King about Silks, they oblig'd themſelves to take every Year 300 Charges, and for which they were to pay 1000 Livres upon every Charge more than the Market-price, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they ſhould be excus'd from paying Cuſtoms for Spices which they ſold in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Upon this, they thriv'd very well before the laſt Wars; but ſince, their Trade is very much weaken'd, and now they carry but little Merchandice into <hi>Perſia.</hi> So that the Benefit they have by the Releaſe of Cuſtoms, does not equal the Gain the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105141:71"/>King makes of his Silks; for the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Court gave 'em ſo very bad, that they could not put 'em to any other uſe, than to make Cordage for their Horſes at <hi>Batavia.</hi> Whereupon four Years ago, they ſent a famous Embaſſie to remedy this Diſorder; and their Ambaſſadour <hi>Van Leenen</hi> made the King a great many magnificent Preſents, to obtain a more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Price upon his Silks; and at laſt with much ado he got it lower'd Thirty Crowns every Charge. But in all likelihood this was only a politick Promiſe, that he might not think much of his Preſents; for he has been never able to get it in Writing ever ſince, though he ſpar'd no Reward to the Great Miniſters; inſomuch, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt this Commerce, when he came to <hi>Lar,</hi> and threatned to bring Ships from <hi>Batavia,</hi> to ruin the Ports of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But the <hi>Perſians</hi> were not ſo ill Politicians, but they knew that their Company was not able to do it, becauſe of ſome <hi>French</hi> Ships that from time to time appear'd in that Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are not the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who do not find it worth their while to traffick into <hi>Perſia;</hi> for their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105141:71"/>Money is become ſo bad, that no body cares to carry their Goods ſo far, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Price in Copper. This Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Money, proceeds from their ſupine neglect to find out the falſe Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and when they have found any,
<note place="margin">Coiners how pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</note> from their contenting themſelves with only confiſcating their Goods, and ſo leaving their Hands at liberty to return to the ſame Trade. More than ten Years a Reformation of this has been labour'd at. The King has ſtamp'd Pieces of very good Allay at <hi>Iſpahan, Erivan, Dadian, Tauris, Ardaville, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madan,</hi> and <hi>Aviſa:</hi> But ſcarce have they come out of the Mint, but they have been immediately ſpirited away to the <hi>Indies,</hi> notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rigorous Edicts the King has made againſt it. They got the <hi>Kan</hi> of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar Abaſſi</hi> on their ſide; and ſo the more Money is coined in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the leſs is to be ſeen in the Kingdom.
<note place="margin">How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</note> They might remedy this Inconvenience, by raiſing the value of thoſe Pieces that were good; for then the <hi>Indians</hi> would not be ſo ready to carry 'em away.</p>
               <p>They have ſo much abated the Price of our Gold and Silver,
<note place="margin">European <hi>Money lower'd in value.</hi>
                  </note> that now no Merchant will carry any thither; but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105141:72"/>our <hi>Zekins</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> are tranſported by way of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora</hi> to the <hi>Indies.</hi> So that <hi>Perſia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Mines, in a ſhort time there will be no Silver in the Kingdom to coin new Pieces.

<note place="margin">The Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies thereby.</note> and the loſs of the Cuſtoms, that other Nations will benefit by.</p>
               <p>The King does not ſuffer this ſo conſiderable loſs by any Ceſſation of Commerce of Silks; for they are now wrought as much as ever, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures are eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Iſpahan, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan, Tauris,</hi> and <hi>Maſched;</hi> but theſe Manufactures, where they work very fine and rich Silks, are made only for the uſe of the Kingdom; for the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> to hinder the utterance of 'em in his Empire, has forbid his Subjects to wear 'em. And the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeldom wear any Gold or Silver, as alſo few others of the Neighbours of <hi>Perſia.</hi> So that theſe Commodities being not in uſe elſewhere, muſt of neceſſity be confin'd to that Kingdom.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> have more reaſon to fear the <hi>Usbeg Tartars</hi> for Enemies;

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105141:75"/>by the vaſt and burning Deſarts, that ſeparate them from the Province of <hi>Kandahar.</hi> They make theſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes in the very hotteſt part of the Summer, and trouble themſelves but little with carrying Proviſions, their natural love of Fleſh enclining 'em to eat any thing;

               <p>Theſe <hi>Usbegs</hi> do not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with only Ravaging; they have at preſent a numerous Army on foot, which has ſo weakened the <hi>Perſian</hi> Troops with their frequent Skirmiſhes and Surprizes for near theſe ſix Years that this War has been begun, that 'tis to be fear'd they may at laſt take the City of <hi>Maſched,</hi> and recover the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Corraſſan,</hi> which <hi>Cha Abbas</hi>

               <p>The care that <hi>Chiek-Sephi</hi> took to Eſtabliſh a particular Sect, which was ſo very different from the other <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> was an admirable Invention to prevent the People from Revolting, through the Solicitations of either the <hi>Turks, Tartars,</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> who are all their Neighbours; for it has imprinted 'em with ſuch an horrour of their belief, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> have a ſaying, That if you ſhould boil together a <hi>Sunni,</hi> that is, a Follower of <hi>Omar,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The ſole Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Kingdom.</note> and all other Superiour Courts of the Kingdom, is the <hi>Diven Begui.</hi> He has a <hi>Derogat</hi> to execute his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, who alſo ſerves as Jaylor, and ſometimes as Judge, to determine petty Criminal Cauſes. The <hi>Kans</hi> are alſo Chief in their own Courts in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105141:79"/>but there always lies an Appeal from them to the <hi>Divan Bigui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Divan Bigui</hi> has no cognizance of Treaſon, for that is try'd in the inner part of the King's Palace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation had to the Council, as I obſerved before. But no Criminal whatever he be, is Sentenc'd without the King's knowledge, who muſt be fully acquainted with the <hi>Sadre</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, who always determines the ſort of Puniſhment according to the Laws preſcribed by the <hi>Imans.</hi> They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in theſe Courts much after the ſame manner with us of <hi>Europe, viz.</hi> by Proofs, Confronting of Witneſſes, and Tortures.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Tortures in uſe in <hi>Perſia</hi> as in <hi>Europe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Manner of putting to the Torture.</note> 1. Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and 2. Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Ordinary by way of Baſtinadoes, which are always given in full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and which cauſe no ordinary Terrour of their Tribunals.</p>
               <p>There are many kinds of Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, which conſiſt alſo of Baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, but after a manner much more Mercileſs and Senſible. For they ſlaſh the bottom of the Heels with Razors, put Salt into their bleeding Wounds,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105141:79"/>and then make uſe of the Battoon; which you muſt needs think is no common Torture. Alſo they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tear off the Nails from their Feet with Pincers. Sometimes they bind the Criminals to four Stakes by the Hands and Feet, and apply red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot Irons to the moſt fleſhy parts; and ſometimes they quite tear out the Fleſh with Pincers. If theſe poor wretches confeſs the Crimes of which they are accuſed, then they deſiſt from Tortures, and proceed to Sentence: Afterwards they deliver the condemn'd to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concern'd,
<note place="margin">The Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Accuſer.</note> to be diſpos'd of at their pleaſure. But if they do not confeſs, the Accuſers muſt pay the Perſon Tortur'd SMart-money, which is allow'd 'em according to their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>'Tis Remarkable, that they do not proceed againſt Murtherers till the Party intereſs'd requires it: So that a Child whoſe Father has been kill'd, is at liberty to revenge or compound for his Blood, without any Check from the Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>When the Party intereſs'd will not Compound, and that he has prov'd the Murther, the <hi>Sadre</hi> determines the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105141:80"/>Puniſhment, and returns the Criminal to the Parties power to take Blood for Blood.</p>
               <p>The Party intereſs'd has none of the Goods Confiſcated; the Court ſeizes upon all; whence it comes to paſs, that Executions are ſeldom pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd when the Criminal has any Money to Compound.</p>
               <p>Their Laws are very ſevere againſt Crimes of Uncleanneſs.
<note place="margin">Rigorous Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities.</note> Women that abuſe their Husbands Beds, are thrown from the top of the <hi>Minarées,</hi> or <hi>Moſque-Steeples.</hi> When a Woman is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of this Crime of Uncleanneſs, they firſt ſhave her Head and daub her Face, and then mount her upon an Aſs with her Face towards the Tail, which the Hang-man leads thro' the Streets, crying before her, <hi>Woe be to Women, who have no care of their Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws of the <hi>Imans</hi> are ſo very rigorous,
<note place="margin">A Story of a Brother that kill'd his Siſter taken in this Crime.</note> that they allow Fathers and Mothers to Stab their Daughters if they take 'em in this Crime. I ſaw an Example of this kind at the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's of the Governour of <hi>Hamadan:</hi> A Mother having ſurpriz'd her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this Act, not being able to vent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105141:80"/>her Anger upon him who had diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd her, made her Daughter the Victim of her Indignation, who had not time to eſcape: For this paſſionate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man calling her Son to her, commanded him to kill his Siſter upon the ſpot; who as haſtily obeying, he had ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe after this Parricide, that he could not content himſelf with Stabbing her, but immediately cut off her Head and carry'd it home in Triumph. His Neighbours came to the Lieutenant's to accuſe him as a Parricide: He was ſeized, and his Mother followed him to the Hall, where I heard all the Circumſtances. The Lieutenant ask'd him why he had kill'd his only Siſter? He anſwered, He had done well, and that he deſerved a Reward rather than a Puniſhment; for in having Stabb'd an Unchaſt Siſter, he had reveng'd the Honour of his Religion which ſhe had defil'd, and waſh'd away a blot which her Crime had caſt upon his Family: And then turning to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gave her a thouſand Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions for having inſpir'd him with ſo noble a deſign. Whereupon he was bid to withdraw, and his Mother commanded to ſtand forth: Where
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105141:81"/>ſhe being ask'd her reaſon for what ſhe did; ſhe preſently juſtify'd her ſelf, and commended the generous Action of her Son. The end of this Tragedy was very ſurprizing; for the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being then at Dinner, gave the Mother Melons and other Fruit from his Table; and after having exalted her Inhumanity, as an Heroick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he gave her Son an Habit for being the Executioner. This ſurpriz'd me very much, and quite took away my ſtomach to my Meat: Which the Lieutenant perceiving, ask'd me, if we did not Judge ſo in <hi>Europe?</hi> I told him, no. And not daring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf farther, and to tell him, we did not uſe to reward Parricides, I was fain to content my ſelf with only offering my Opinion, That this Mother ought firſt to have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Court for Juſtice againſt her Daughter, and not to take ſo much upon her without Orders. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that that was true; but that he was oblig'd to determine ſo, according to the Laws of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> which made me have a ſecret pity for the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that are ſo much blinded by their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and who are otherwiſe the moſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105141:81"/>Knowing, Poliſh'd, Politick, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional of all the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They puniſh ſeverely all Children that abuſe their Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<note place="margin">Puniſhment of Children for abuſing Fathers or Mothers.</note> For if any one be convicted of ſuch a Crime, they immediately cut out his Tongue; and if they ſtrike 'em, they cut off their Arms.</p>
               <p>The King deputes oftentimes the <hi>Divan Begui,</hi> as great a Lord as he is,
<note place="margin">The Judges and greateſt Lords aſſiſt at Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> to aſſiſt at Executions, or, at leaſt, he muſt ſend one of the greateſt Lords of the Court in his Room. A poor <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholick being found in the Road where the King was to paſs, with his Ladies, he was ſeiz'd, and condemn'd to have his Head cut off. Whereupon the <hi>Kouler Agaſſi,</hi> who is the chief Favourite, and one of the Four great Officers of State, was commanded to aſſiſt at his Execution, and to offer him Mercy if he would renounce Chriſtianity, and become <hi>Mahometan.</hi> But the Chriſtian refuſing his Offers, kept firm to his Faith. And perceiving this Favourite delay'd his Death, with hopes he would comply, broke out into theſe words:
<note place="margin">Martyrdom of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> 
                  <hi>Do not expect that I can be ſo baſe to forſake my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Truth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105141:82"/>to follow the Belief of an Impoſtor;</hi> whereupon his deſires were immediately accompliſh'd, and his Faith recompens'd, for his Head was ſtruck off in a trice, and thrown to the Dogs. I was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and at my earneſt intreaty his Body was taken from the Dogs, and buried in the <hi>Franks</hi> Church yard.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> have not ſet Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for every Crime.
<note place="margin">Divers Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> They make uſe of a Gibbet after a very cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for they faſten the Patient by the Throat with an Iron Hook, and there let him hang till he periſh. They have another ſort of Puniſhment yet more cruel than the former, and that is, They bind the Criminal upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel's Back, and then open his Belly, as a Butcher does a Sheep, and thus they lead him about the Streets with his Guts hanging out, and who will live ſometimes Two or Three Days in this Condition. The Puniſhment for Thieves is particular: They put 'em into a Ditch up to the Middle, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fill it with Plaiſter, which gives the Patient exceſſive Tortures aſſoon as it is dry.</p>
               <p>Empaling is not in uſe, no more than Fire: They have no Wheels, but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105141:82"/>yet they have Puniſhments as cruel. They lay the Patient upon a broad Board, and there haſh his Body into ſmall Pieces.</p>
               <p>The Governours Lieutenants have no power to condemn to death till they have permiſſion from the King by a <hi>Brevet.</hi> The <hi>Derogats</hi> may Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, or cut off the Noſes and Ears of Butchers and Bakers, aſſoon as ever the Lieutenant of the Policies has convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted 'em of ſelling too dear, or by falſe Weights. But none except the <hi>Kans,</hi> a few <hi>Sultans,</hi> and privileged <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogats</hi> can condemn to death; which cauſes a great diſorder in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for the Thieves will be ſure to ravage that Country moſt where they know there's none have Authority to Condemn 'em.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Divan Begui</hi> (as I have remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) is the chief of the Civil Juſtice,
<note place="margin">Of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Juſtice.</note> as well as the Four Great <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This Court is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the Subject, for there are neither Meſſengers, Councellors, or Attorneys. Every one may exhibit his own Cauſe by way of Petition: Every one pleads for himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends his own Right: They have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105141:83"/>Cryers to command Silence; and their Audiences are always very tumultuous; and he that ſpeaks loudeſt has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the better of the Day. They never paſs Judgment by Default, which is the reaſon that he who was in the wrong oftentimes ſaves himſelf by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a good Compoſition.</p>
               <p>The Laws of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> by which they ſteer their Judgments, oftentimes ſubject People to a great many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies: For a Man that lends his Money is always in danger of loſing it, according to theſe Laws. If he to whom it is lent be of good Repute, and has no Money ready to pay, the other cannot bring his Action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſiderable Damage to himſelf, for he muſt pay the Tenth part of the Summ immediately, and all the Coſts of Suit. If the Defendant confeſs the Debt, they always give him a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time for Payment. He that has the better on't pays the Coſts; which Law is not juſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alcoran</hi> forbids Uſury;
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</note> but the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> never mind it. For Example: If they lend 100 Crowns for a Year, they compute what Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt they might make by it, and that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105141:83"/>can never be leſs than Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">However practiſed.</note> ſo that they add that to the principal Summ in the Bond before-hand.</p>
               <p>This Craft will ſignifie nothing if the Debtor be a Knave; for at the end of the Term he'll deny to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the full Sum, and ſo offering to lay down in Court the 100 Crowns, he'll avoid the Intereſt. 10 <hi>per Cent</hi> for the Judge's Box, and all the Coſts of Suit.</p>
               <p>This Court is very ridiculous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in reſpect of a Defendant that will deny his Debt, for there he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to do it contrary to his own Hand-writing, and the Teſtimony of the Judge, who ſaw the Money lent, and put his Hand and Seal to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: Nevertheleſs the Defendant need but deny the Fact boldly, and the Creditor will be ordered to make Proof of the Loan, and to produce his Witneſſes, or he will be Non-ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Theſe Two things are equally prejudicial to the Creditor; for to prove any Act according to their Laws, they muſt produce Seventy Two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who muſt all very near equal the <hi>Imans</hi> in Integrity, if not wholly. The expreſs Words of the Law are
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105141:84"/>theſe, <hi>That to be believ'd, the Witneſſes muſt be either Imans, or Naib Imans,</hi> that is, Saints, or Deputies of Saints. There are not wanting in <hi>Perſia</hi> People that can equal theſe pretended Saints in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Knavery, and Murther; but they muſt alſo equal 'em in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, Treachery, and being worſe than their Word. A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd for Evidence, and much leſs a Jew, Indian, or follower of <hi>Omar.</hi> Therefore you may judge in what Confuſion a Creditor muſt needs be, who is oblig'd to find ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch choice Witneſſes. He ought to have lent his Money by ſound of Trumpet, to have got ſo many to have prov'd the Fact.</p>
               <p>I affirm that it is almoſt impoſſible for a Plaintiff to prove his Debt; ſo that he muſt always yield himſelf Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit when he commences a Suit, unleſs he relies upon Remorſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ſeldom or never trouble the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> eſpecially when they are to injure a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But if he be ſo happy to ſee any reluctance in his Adverſary for a falſe Oath, all his Good Fortune will amount but to this, that he muſt compound for a Third
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105141:84"/>part, out of which the Judge will have alſo his Tenth. When the Debtor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Debt, the Plaintiff is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſwear it after what manner, and with what Circumſtances he pleaſes, but it will ſignify nothing.</p>
               <p>I can never remember without Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror after what a cruel manner I ſaw an Oath forc'd from a Chriſtian in the Province of <hi>Naxivan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A cruel manner of putting a Chriſtian to his Oath.</note> where the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> are <hi>Catholicks.</hi> A Renegado made an Inſult upon a Chriſtian, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 2000 Crowns which he ſaid he lent him upon his Word, without Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but having no Witneſſes to prove it, he would needs put him to his Oath. And to that purpoſe hal'd away this poor Chriſtian by force to his own Church, follow'd by a Crowd of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> where ſcattering of Bread all the way up to the Altar, he forc'd him to walk upon it with Two Dogs tied to his Arms, and in this manner he oblig'd him to lay his Hand upon the Evangeliſts, and to ſwear with a Thouſand Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that were enough to frighten one, that he ow'd him nothing. This Man, who was an honeſt Merchant, would have willingly given him 100
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105141:85"/>Crowns to have freed himſelf from ſuch a Scandal, and his Church from ſo great a Profanation; but he might as well have offer'd a Penny to ſatisfie the whole Sum; for he was reſolv'd he ſhould drink out of the Chalice in that poſture, which gave me as much unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and diſlike as it did him.</p>
               <p>If there be ſo much hazard in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or Lending Money in <hi>Perſia,</hi> there is without doubt no leſs in Buying Lands or Houſes; for whatever care is taken of the Contract, the Seller may deny he ever ſold 'em; or if he owns the ſelling, yet he may deny receiving of his Money, and ſo put the Buyer upon proving it, which perhaps he would never be able to do. Therefore the beſt way is to take immediate Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and to let the other prove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and illegal.</p>
               <p>The Soveraign Judge of the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Religion,
<note place="margin">Tribunal of Religion.</note> is the <hi>Sadre Caſſa,</hi> who is the Chief Pontiff, or Archbiſhop of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and whoſe Deputies are the <hi>Modarrés</hi> in all Provinces, but from whom there lies an Appeal to this Court.</p>
               <p>This Tribunal is very like the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for 'tis here that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety

               <p>

               <p>'Tis alſo in this Court that they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law of <hi>Iman Dgafar,</hi> which adjudges all the Goods of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Family, to but one of 'em that ſhall become <hi>Mahometan;</hi> for the reſt may ſtarve, if they don't think fit to follow his wicked Example.

               <p>This eaſie Method of returning to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is mightily practis'd by the <hi>Armenians,</hi> when they have a mind to elude the Law of <hi>Iman Dgafar;</hi> for you ſhall ſee a rich <hi>Armenian,</hi> if he finds any of his Family turn <hi>Mahometans,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Circumciſe one of his Sons, to prevent their having his Eſtate: And afterwards if his Renegado Relation die without Iſſue, then he ſhall preſent a Petition to the <hi>Sadre,</hi> back'd with a rich Preſent, to permit his Son to recant. But if he does not die, then it is his Buſineſs to keep in with his Son, that he may not take the advantage the Law has given him and ſo himſelf and the reſt of his Children ſuffer. This wicked Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys thouſands of Souls, without any Remedy to prevent it.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Turks</hi> are very far from this Cuſtom; for they, inſtead of making a Renegado ſole Heir of the Family, will not ſo much as allow him a ſhare with his Brothers, they thinking him very well provided for, by the Choice he has made of their Religion: And a Return to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> with them is puniſh'd by Fire.</p>

<note place="margin">Sacred Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</note> the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts;</hi> but theſe <hi>Divine Writers</hi> have been all perverted by <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They object againſt the <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> who make uſe of Arguments out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> againſt 'em, that 'tis the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> have corrupted thoſe Writings, and interpreted 'em according to their own purpoſe: As for Example; In the 14th. Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> where our Saviour ſays to his Apoſtles, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> that is, the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>whom my Father ſhall ſend in my Name, ſhall teach you all things:</hi> They ſay, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> have blotted out the Name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which they pretend was the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> promis'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alcoran</hi> teaches the Belief of one God,
<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of a Deity.</note> Creator of Heaven and Earth, Holy, Eternal, Immenſe, Good, Juſt, Almighty, and Infinite in all kinds of Perfection. One of the moſt abſurd
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105141:87"/>Fancies you find in this Book, is, where it ſays, That God having created the World, bore it up on the Horns of a Bull, of ſo prodigious an heighth, that each of his Horns took up as much ſpace, as an Horſeman well-mounted could traverſe in a thouſand Days, though he rid never ſo ſwift. But this Animal, as prodigious as he was, had but a very thin Skin; for the pricking of a Fly, would ſpur and move him; from whence, ſays <hi>Mahomet,</hi> proceed Earth-quakes.</p>
               <p>But they altogether reject the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Bleſſed <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>TRINITY,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They deny the Trinity.</note> and the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>WORD.</hi> They ſay, That <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> was pure Man, a Great Prophet, the True Meſſias promis'd to the <hi>Jews:</hi> That he was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, a Favourite of God, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for his many Miracles. Alſo, That he is not dead, but was carry'd into Heaven, whilſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> thinking they had crucified him, only vented their Malice upon <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> whom they had taken for him. This is the ſum of what the <hi>Perſians</hi> believe concerning God.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:105141:88"/>
               <p>Alſo they have very abſurd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the Angels;
<note place="margin">Opinion of Angels.</note> for they believe 'em corporeal, and capable of committing the groſſeſt Sins: That the Bad Angels have been created of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous Fire; and thoſe that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd favour before God.</p>
               <p>They believe the Immortality of the Soul,
<note place="margin">Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul.</note> and that there is a future Life where God will reward the Good, and puniſh the Wicked. Their Paradiſe conſiſts in nothing but ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. They pray for the Dead, and interr 'em with abundance of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>They Honour all ſuch Saints,
<note place="margin">What Saints they Honour.</note> who have lived in perfect Obedience to their Law. The Twelve chief Deſcendants from <hi>Ali</hi> have the firſt place amongſt 'em. They have the Interpretation of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from them, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no other: They ſolemnize Feaſts to their Memory. The laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of the Year they celebrate one in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Fatma,</hi> Wife of <hi>Ali,</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> This <hi>Fatma,</hi> to content the Potters, who complain'd of their bad Trade, caus'd her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks to break all the Pitchers that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105141:88"/>came to her Fountain, the laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> of the Year, which is the reaſon that in memory of ſo laudable an Action, they now every Year on the ſame Day break all the Pots and Pitchers that come into their hands.</p>
               <p>There are no Altars in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or any Ornaments; they there aſſemble together to Pray, to hear the Interpretation of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and to celebrate Marriages: Theſe Temples are call'd <hi>Moſques.</hi> They do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Sacrifices here, but in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places, where they ſacrifice every Year a Camel, in remembrance of that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which they believe to have been ſuch a Beaſt, and not a Ram, which he kill'd inſtead of his Son <hi>Iſmael,</hi> whom they take for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This Sacrifice is perform'd on the Tenth of the Month <hi>Zilhadgea,</hi> with a great deal of Ceremony. Amongſt the Camels that have made the Voyage of <hi>Mecca,</hi> they chuſe a White one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that which <hi>Mahomet</hi> us'd commonly to ride, was of that Colour. This Camel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cover'd with rich Silk, adorn'd with Garlands, and carrying Bells tied to his Legs, Neck, and Ears, is led
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105141:89"/>with ſound of Inſtruments about the City the ſpace of Ten Days, by the Captains of Diviſions, each of 'em in his turn. They run after this Animal, and happy is he that can pluck ſome of his Hair. The Cries they make, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Noiſe of Inſtruments of Muſick, and Jingling of Bells, make a terrible Concert. He is led the Tenth Day to the Gate of the Principal Moſque, where the Pontiff bleſſes him, and delivers him over to the Lieutenant-Criminal, who leading him out of the City, the King pierces him with his Lance. In the King's abſence, this Honour is conferr'd upon the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Criminal. When the firſt Blow is given, every one gives his, and the Camel is cut to pieces in a trice. They take one Piece for the King's Table, and the Lords alſo take theirs. That Captain that gets the biggeſt Piece afterwards, is declar'd Conquerour, and the Honour of his Victory is ſpread throughout his Diviſion. This Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ended, the King makes a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Their Prayers conſiſt of nothing elſe but an Enumeration of the Attributes of GOD;
<note place="margin">Their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> yet they always intermix
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105141:89"/>the Names of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Ali,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Firſt <hi>Reſſoul Allah,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or <hi>Envoy</hi> of God, and the Second <hi>Veloul Allah,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of God. They have a ſort of Bead-roll, by which they number their Prayers. They pray thrice a day; firſt, at Sun-riſing; ſecondly, at Noon; and, thirdly at Sun-ſet: But the <hi>Turks</hi> pray five times at five diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hours. The Ceremonies they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at Prayer, are only a great many Proſtrations and Reverences. They always ſalute at the end of their Prayers their Good and Bad Angels. They move their Heads continually, when they read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> for fear they ſhould pronounce the Name of God without bowing. When they Pray, they always turn their Faces towards the South; and that's the reaſon they have always a Compaſs about 'em. They ſpread a little Carpet, and place upon it a piece of Load-ſtone, their Bead-roll, the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and a Comb, with which they adjuſt their Beards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Pray.</p>
               <p>They have different kinds of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications,
<note place="margin">Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſome to prepare 'em for Prayer, and others to expiate their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105141:90"/>Sins: In theſe, they imitate the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they practiſe like them all ſorts of lawful Purifications; but they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their Whimſies and Impertinencies much farther, even to ridiculous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions that deſerve pity; and it is the Duty of an Evangelick Labourer, who is zealous for the Salvation of Souls, to follow them in all their Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings and Strayings, and to ſeek for plauſible Arguments to convince and convert 'em with patience.</p>
               <p>They obſerve Circumciſion,
<note place="margin">Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but 'tis only by Tradition; for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes no ſuch thing: They Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Children at Thirteen Years old, becauſe of <hi>Iſmael</hi> their Patriarch, who was Circumcis'd at the ſame Age.</p>
               <p>They obſerve a Faſt of Thirty Days:
<note place="margin">A Faſt.</note> They are forbid to eat and drink in the Day-time; but at Night they do as they pleaſe. This Faſt is follow'd by a great Feaſt.</p>
               <p>When they have tranſgreſs'd this Law of the Faſt, they immediately go and accuſe themſelves to the Pontiff; who, after having made 'em lay their Hands on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſworn not to commit the like Crimes again, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105141:90"/>on 'em ſlight Penances. This ſort of Confeſſion, which they call <hi>Toba,</hi> is alſo in uſe when they have violated the other Laws of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> have Doctors,
<note place="margin">Perſian <hi>Doctors.</hi>
                  </note> who are ſubſtitute to a Chief they call <hi>Sadre,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before: They have recourſe to him upon all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ariſe about their Religion; and thoſe that will not ſubmit to their Deciſions, are puniſh'd with Death.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Subordinations amongſt the Miniſters of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Religion:
<note place="margin">Spiritual Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> The <hi>Sadre Caſſa,</hi> Univerſal Chief; the <hi>Sadre Elmam Alek,</hi> his Vicar-General; the <hi>Chiek Aliſlam,</hi> is as his Archdeacon; and the <hi>Cazi,</hi> his Official. In the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cities of Provinces, there is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darrés</hi> for each City. He has the ſame Officers as the <hi>Sadre Caſſa:</hi> His Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is divided into certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, as our Archdeaconries and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries: The Deans have under them the <hi>Catiffs,</hi> who are the Curates, and <hi>Moullahs,</hi> or Prieſts are under them.</p>
               <p>They have Religious People which they call <hi>Derviches,</hi> or <hi>Abdals;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are Publick Schools in <hi>Perſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Publick Schools.</note> where the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is explain'd by the Doctors; they alſo there teach Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, Aſtronomy, Law, and Phyſick. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is their Guide for Philoſophy, and <hi>Avicen</hi> for Phyſick. The Study of the Laws is very much eſteem'd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt 'em; for Magiſtrates apply their Children ſtrictly to it, and they alſo take great care to inſtruct 'em in it themſelves, by asking every day their Opinion in ſome Caſe they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged.</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>Perſia</hi> different <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Sects:
<note place="margin">different Sects.</note> for <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> is there ſo divided, that there are almoſt as many different Opinions, as there are different Conditions. The Belief of a Trades-man is not the ſame with a Scholars; and the Courtier has alſo one particular to himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:105141:91"/>
               <p>The mean People follow the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and affirm,
<note place="margin">Belief of the Vulgar.</note> that the Myſteries therein contain'd, are not to be comprehended. This Prevention is an unſurmountable Obſtacle to their Converſion. When the Miſſionaries have endeavour'd to convince 'em of ſome Abſurdities of their Faith, they have anſwer'd only, That they were Myſteries, and therefore not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into, nor comprehended; and that God had reſerv'd the knowledge of them alone to himſelf, and his Prophet.</p>
               <p>Learned Men explain the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>

Alſo they have had the honeſty to confeſs, when they have been Convinced, that our Arguments had a great deal of force over 'em.

               <p>The laſt Year I travell'd by <hi>Ouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerd:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ouriguerd <hi>a City, where ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate.</hi>
                  </note> This City is in the 13th De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Equator; 'tis ſituate upon the Border of <hi>Suſiana</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> built in Amphitheatre, upon the declining of a little Hill, ſomething like an Horſe-Shooe. At the Foot of theſe Walls runs the River <hi>Gamaſan.</hi> The Governour of this City is a <hi>Sultan,</hi> who keeps in it 1000 Horſemen, which ſerve for a Guard to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There are no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> here; but there are abundance of <hi>Jews.</hi> When I brought a Letter from the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to our King, an Officer of the Court with two Life-Guard-men
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105141:92"/>accompanied me, with expreſs Orders to defray my Expences throughout the Kingdom. At this place the <hi>Pontiff</hi> came to ſee me at the Mayor's Houſe, where I was lodg'd: His viſit was chiefly employ'd to propoſe Queſtions of Religion; and amongſt others, he ask'd me, If Wine was not forbid <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well as <hi>Mahometans?</hi> I anſwer'd him, We ſometimes abſtain from it upon account of Penitence, and our Law controll'd the exceſſive uſe of it; but it did not forbid it as an ill thing. I added moreover, That it was with Wine as with all other things which God had created for the uſe of Man, they were all good in themſelves, but that unruly Luſts,
<note place="margin">Defence of Wine.</note> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Sin, abus'd the beſt things, and render'd 'em bad: That Wine was good after that manner the Patriarchs uſed to drink it; that it was made uſe of by <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> in his Sacrifices; that the Outrages we ſee too often committed thro' the Exceſs of it, are not ſufficient Reaſons or Arguments to condemn and forbid it. For by the ſame reaſon you might forbid Meat, becauſe ſome Men are Gluttons; and ſo People would be depriv'd of both
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105141:93"/>the kinds of natural Suſtenance. <hi>I believe truly,</hi> reply'd the Pontiff, <hi>it was only the ill uſe of Wine that made</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met <hi>forbid it. Our Interpreters have not fully underſtood the Law of the</hi> Alcoran, <hi>but you have found out its true meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we began to talk of Marriage;
<note place="margin">Polygamy condemn'd.</note> whereupon he ask'd me, If Polygamy were allow'd to <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> I told him, No; and that I believed he would agree with me, That the Goſpel in that, as well as all other things, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principles of right Reaſon. <hi>What time</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>do you believe that Reaſon has been in its greateſt Purity and Strength?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>In</hi> Adam<hi>'s time, before the Fall. You know then,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>how many Wives he had at that time; this is clear enough in the</hi> Turat, that is, the <hi>Bible. He had but One,</hi> ſays he. <hi>Then hence I muſt draw my Concluſion,</hi> reply'd <hi>I, That the Law of pure and right Reaſon permits but One Wife, and therefore thoſe Laws that allow many are manifeſtly Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</hi> I added, moreover, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Inconveniencies ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Polygamy; ſo that at length he ſeem'd entirely ſatisfied.

                  <p>My Lord, ſaid I, God has given you great Knowledge to apprehend the obſcureſt Caſes, therefore I would make you Judge of the following one. A Man comes to complain at your Tribunal, that his Father has been kill'd: The Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is preſent, and confeſſes and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his Crime: A Third comes a great while afterwards, and denies the Fact. Would your Lordſhip now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Man? Would you receive his Evidence? No, ſays he, but I would immediately order him 100 blows on his Feet for a Reward of his Impudence. Pardon me then, my Lord, ſaid I, if I proceed to make
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105141:94"/>the Application of this Parable. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> complain their Father has been murther'd on the Croſs: The <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge they have been the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers: Then ought <hi>Mahomet</hi> to come 600 Years afterwards to give 'em the Lye? Why then, ſays the Intendant, the Prophet comes under the Batoon: Ay, ſays the Governour laughing, but the Doctors will preſently deliver him, for I have paſt Sentence according to forms.</p>
                  <p>But when we grant, reply'd the Intendant, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is dead, does it follow that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God? No, anſwer'd I, but the Advantage I ſhall have over you, will be ſufficient to prove that in this Point, at leaſt, <hi>Mahomet</hi> has deceiv'd you; and if he has deceiv'd you in this Point, ought you then to believe him in other Points? If he be not to be believ'd when he ſays that Chriſt was not dead, is he any more when he ſays that Chriſt is not God? But I do not pretend to prove the Divinity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by his Death, I have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enough from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> has allow'd in his <hi>Alcoran</hi> to have been reveal'd by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105141:95"/>the Holy Ghoſt to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I mean from thoſe very Scriptures that he has commanded you to have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for as the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> 'Tis true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Intendant, we do allow the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures, but not ſuch as you have made 'em by altering them in a Thouſand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to deduce Arguments to prove the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I know very well, my Lord, anſwer'd I, that this you always charge us with in all your Conferences with us: But if you will be pleas'd to honour me with the ſame Attention you have hitherto done, I do not doubt but to ſhew you, That this Objection is not ſufficiently maintain'd. Do's it ſuffice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us (think you) that we have falſify'd the Scriptures, becauſe they are found to differ from thoſe Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Mahomet</hi> has made in his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> and have not we the ſame grounds to reproach you, that it was <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf that alter'd 'em? But to make an end of this Conteſt, my Lord, let us take a Third Perſon, who ſhall be neither <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan:</hi> I appeal to our greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105141:95"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Caſe, even thoſe that have crucified our Saviour, the Author and Conſummator of our Faith; Let them ſpeak whether they think we have falſified the Scriptures? if thoſe we profeſs are not the ſame with theirs? Let 'em lay before you the Holy Books, even ſuch as they have receiv'd 'em from the Prophets, and let 'em determine if there be any difference? I am very well aſſur'd they would not ſay the leaſt to the contrary. I know they would accuſe us of not underſtanding 'em, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they would readily grant, we have alter'd nothing. By theſe means nothing is more eaſie than to end this difference between us. There are <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt you as well as all other Nations; and I dare be bold to affirm, That the reaſon that God ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd this People ſo wide in the World, was the better to give an univerſal Teſtimony of the Divinity of his Son. The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, ſaid he, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me, were the firſt that falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd the Scriptures. I know, reply'd I, my Lord, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> in many places of his <hi>Alcoran</hi> does accuſe 'em of it, but had he any reaſonable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105141:96"/>grounds for what he ſaid? When did the <hi>Jews</hi> falſifie the Scriptures? Was it before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appear'd in the World? or was it after? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will not ſay it was before <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and I inſiſt upon but Two or Three Reaſons to prove it was not after. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em of ſo many Diſorders, wou'd he, think you, have omitted ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Prevarication as to falſify the Holy Scriptures? And can any one imagine, that being to quote 'em ſo often in his Inſtructions to Men, on the account of his Father, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he would have quoted 'em ſo falſifi'd by the <hi>Jews;</hi> for it evidently appears, that he ſpake the very ſame they have in their Hands: Alſo you cannot think the <hi>Jews</hi> corrupted 'em after his Death, when they believ'd him an Impoſtor, and one that juſtiy ſuffer'd for offering to ſeduce 'em. Would not they have alter'd all the places that plainly prove him and his Apoſtles Holy, which he employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 'em.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And now perceiving that my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments had begun to make ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Intendant, I added
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105141:96"/>farther, <q>That it was plain the <hi>Jews</hi> had not falſify'd the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, tho' they might very well have inclinations to do ſo; neither ought this reproach to be caſt upon <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </q> Then applying my ſelf to the Intendant, I went on in this manner: <q>You ſeem to ſay they had a proſpect by this falſification, to prove the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and if ſo, pray, At what time ſhould they have done it? Should it have been at the beginning of Chriſtianity? or was it only in the time of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet?</hi> If it had been in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity, it muſt have been done by the Apoſtles, or thoſe that immediately ſucceeded 'em. But it was not done by the Apoſtles you grant, by demanding at every foot, the Goſpel as it came out of their hands. Neither was it done by their immediate Succeſſors, is plain; For how ſhould theſe Men have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prove the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if the Apoſtles had ſaid he was meer Man? And would not there have been Men then living, who would have contradicted 'em? Theſe very Men that ſaw the Scriptures in their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105141:97"/>Purity, would they have ſuffer'd 'em to have been alter'd by ſo difficult a point of Faith, without any gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying? Do you think that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had hitherto been able to paſs for no more than meer Man, muſt all of a ſudden have become God, upon the bare Teſtimony of ſome Paſſages inſerted into thoſe Holy Books, and which would have been ſo eaſily detected by every body? And this Falſification has not been done in the time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I'm ſure, tho' he reproaches us with it; for does he ſhew us any Ancient Book where <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Humanity is mentioned without his Divinity? Another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, my Lord, comes in my mind. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you ſay, have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect by this Falſification, to prove that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was GOD. Then they ought to have left in the Bible, only thoſe Actions that were for his Grandeur and Divinity: Such as the Prophecy of the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> which foretold, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be ſtil'd, <hi>The Son of the moſt High:</hi> That he ſhould Reign for ever in the Houſe of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that he ſhould deliver his People from their Sins: Alſo the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105141:97"/>Miracle of his Conception by the Operations of the Holy Ghoſt: His Birth of a Virgin: The Miracles he perform'd: His Transfiguration on <hi>Mount Tabor:</hi> His Triumphant Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven: The Deſcenſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles: And, His laſt coming in Glory to Judge the World. The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I ſay, ought only to have left theſe Actions in the Holy Goſpel; and if they had any deſign to prove his Divinity by an Alteration, they ſhould have retrench'd all the other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Life, which were Arguments of Humanity and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As, His Birth in a Stable; His Flight into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to avoid the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a Tyrant: The Hunger he ſuffer'd in the Deſart: His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues in his Journey he undertook for the Inſtruction of Men; and his Wearineſs and Thirſt when he ſat at Noon upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well: The Tears he wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he foretold the Miſeries he ſaw would fall upon her: Alſo thoſe he ſhed upon the Tomb of <hi>Lazarus:</hi> The Mortal Affliction his Soul was ſeiz'd with in the <hi>Garden of Olives,</hi> at the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105141:98"/>ſight of the Torments he was a-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuffer: The Prayer he made to his Father three times, to remove the bitter Cup far from him: The Humble Circumſtances of his Paſſion: And laſtly, His Ignominious Death. It was a Glorious and Triumphing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that they ought to have preach'd, and not one that could be humbled and ty'd to a Croſs. The Zeal you ſee us have, my Lord, to maintain that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dy'd on the Croſs, ſhould be a Motive to encline you to believe us. For elſe why could not we agree with you that it was <hi>Judas</hi> was Crucify'd in his place, and ſpare our ſelves the ſhame of Adoring a God fix'd to a Gibbet. But 'tis this ſhame alone which is the cauſe of our Glory. We Preach <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> Crucify'd, which is a ſubject of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to you a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Mockery and Laughter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Curioſity the <hi>Perſians</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, gives the Miſſionaries a great advantage over 'em. To Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert 'em to Chriſtianity, there is need of a great deal of Candour and even Temper, and little or no Paſſion, or over-hot Zeal. They will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105141:98"/>a Man inſpir'd with the Spirit of God, who is govern'd by Rage and Paſſion. Alſo as they have themſelves a great deal of Flegm, too brisk a Method would not have its end. To make 'em ſenſible of the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Abſurdities of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> has prov'd to me of great uſe. Alſo as they have the Bible and ſome of the Fathers amongſt 'em, we might adviſe 'em to read 'em. They find out themſelves how different thoſe Hiſtories are from the Fables of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> left 'em in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> This Reading has been a means God has made uſe of to induce many of the Greateſt Men about 'em to be led to the true knowledge of him and his Son.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Laureſtan</hi> I took my Journey towards <hi>Hamadan,</hi> a City of <hi>Media,</hi> and Capital of a Province of the ſame Name, and chief Reſidence of a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueler-Begui.</hi> 'Tis ſituate at the foot of <hi>Mount Alvand,</hi> which the <hi>Perſians</hi> call <hi>Sultan Alvand,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Queen of the Mountains;</hi> becauſe it is the moſt Fertile, and one of the higheſt in all <hi>Perſia.</hi> It is a branch of <hi>Mount Taurus,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:105141:99"/>which leaves it at the Town of <hi>Zen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and runs even to the <hi>Perſian Gulf.</hi> The famous <hi>Avicen</hi> liv'd a great while upon this Mountain to make his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon Simples, with which it is all cover'd over. <hi>Hamadan</hi> has 35 degrees and 12 Minutes of <hi>Polar Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> It is a very Ancient City, as may be judg'd by the ruins of a new Magnificent Temple there, and of which there remains nothing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but a very high Dome, built with Bricks, and Painted like <hi>Porcelane,</hi> upon which appear ſome few <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters. Under this Dome there is a Chappel 18 foot ſquare, where are the Tombs of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai:</hi> Upon theſe Tombs are rais'd two ſtately <hi>Mauſoleums,</hi> made of a very hard Wood, and Engraven with the Story of <hi>Heſter</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters. Upon <hi>Heſter</hi>'s Tomb is writ, <hi>The Great Queen HESTER;</hi> and on <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s, <hi>Theſe Mauſoleums have been plac'd here by</hi> Ardachir, <hi>or</hi> Arſaces; But there is no Date to diſtinguiſh which of the <hi>Arſaces</hi> is meant. The <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> of <hi>Mordecai</hi> is on the right hand: It has 7 foot in length and heighth, upon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105141:99"/>3 of breadth. That of <hi>Heſter</hi> is on the left, built after the ſame faſhion, only it is a foot higher than that of <hi>Mordecai.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> keep there a great number of Lamps, which burn Night and Day. They Pray here only on their great Days. Our Houſe was not far from this Temple. We were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd there in 1684. I brought the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Patents thither, obtain'd by our King's Recommendation, and which confirm our Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>One day making a Viſit about our Affairs to a <hi>Perſian</hi> Lord, call'd, <hi>Reza-Kouli-Begue,</hi> a <hi>Dervich;</hi> a Man of very good Sence, an excellent Philoſopher, and one that was very well read in the Holy Scriptures: He of a ſudden turn'd all the diſcourſe upon Religion. He began by giving great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Chriſtian Faith, and ſaid,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That he thought it every where very conformable to Reaſon, unleſs in that place where it teaches that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is GOD. 'Tis true, reply'd I, we do acknowledge his Divinity; that Point is the Foundation of our Religion: But what amazes me is, That you ſhould have the ſame thing in your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105141:100"/>
                     <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and yet not believe it: For, under correction, what ſignifies <hi>Rouh Allah,</hi> which is the word that <hi>Mahomet</hi> gives to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> This <hi>Arabian</hi> word,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arguments with a</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian <hi>Lord, to prove Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
                     </note> ſays he, for I have thoroughly ſtudy'd that Language, ſignifies the Spirit or Soul of God. This Spirit or Soul of God, then ſaid I, is it diſtinct from God, or the ſame thing with him? It cannot be diſtinct from him, without doubt, ſays he. Then, reply'd I, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt be God: For what is the ſame thing with God is God. He ſeem'd touch'd with this concluſion; but I extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his being ſo Ingenuous as to give me the true ſenſe of the word <hi>Rouh Allah.</hi> I have not met with, ſaid I, in other <hi>Mahometans,</hi> the like ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; they have always given this word a different ſenſe, to elude the conſequence I have drawn from it.</p>
                  <p>We all, reply'd <hi>Reza Kouli-Begue,</hi> acknowledge <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for a Divine Perſon, and we have for him a very great reſpect; when you <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do but ſlight and vilifie our Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> You reſpect <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaid I, becauſe you every where
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105141:100"/>meet with a Saint in his Character that moves you: but ſhew me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Life, the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of ſuch Characters. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> becauſe you own him for a Prophet, ſent by God to Man; and you acknowledge him ſuch by evident Proofs of his Holineſs, which you are not able to reſiſt But is there any one that can give us ſuch an Idea of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> What has been his Conduct? What Doctrine has he taught Men? By what Miracles has he prov'd that he was ſent from God? What Prophets have foretold his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or his Conduct? I ſhall not inſiſt, Sir, upon any ſhameful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Life, becauſe I'm well aſſur'd that you your ſelf do ſecretly deteſt 'em in your heart. His Conduct! No, Sir, I have too good an opinion of you, to ſay any thing of that. It is not from his Conduct, I'm ſure, that you believe him a Prophet. His <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where he has dar'd to publiſh his own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, in all Ages will riſe up in Judgment againſt him. And had you never ſo many Miracles to boaſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105141:101"/>in his behalf, his Infamous Life alone, would be enough to cancel 'em all; and no Man of good ſenſe would ſuffer himſelf to be gain'd to his Party. But now I think on't, what Miracles can you alledge in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? His Voyage to Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Horſe <hi>Alborach,</hi> to whom he promiſes Paradiſe; and the Moon divided by his Fingers; but theſe Miracles are certainly fit for none but the blind Vulgar to believe; all Learned Men muſt needs laugh at 'em. <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf acknowledg'd, that God had not given him the gift of Miracles. Now as to his Doctrine, how many Whimſies are there through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole <hi>Alcoran?</hi> How many Contradictions and Abſurdities, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite even to good Manners and right Reaſon: Such as the World born up upon the Horns of a Bull; Angels form'd out of peſtiferous Fire; Heaven compos'd of Smoak; the Sun plac'd in a Fountain of hot Water; a Blazing-Star detach't from the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament to pull down the Devils from Heaven, when they came ſo near as to hearken to what was ſaid:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105141:101"/>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> entertaining himſelf with Ants and Birds; his Letters carry'd to the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> by flakes of Snow; the Devils and Birds, which compoſe his Armies; God ſwearing by Figs and Bees, and juſt afterwards the quite contrary, by Cows: Wine forbid in one Chapter, and allowed in another; and a thouſand other Abſurdities of the like nature, which ſufficiently ſatisfie us what this Doctrine of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>At leaſt 'twas neceſſary that God ſhould have given Man ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and evident Sign of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s coming from him: There ought to have been Prophecies of this New Legiſlator, which might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd Man's belief in him: But pray what Prophecies have there been? Which of all the Prophets has ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him? <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, (cry'd the <hi>Dervich</hi>) in that paſſage where he promiſes to ſend the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, and which ought to be underſtood of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> for his Name was actually in the Goſpel, before you blotted it out.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105141:102"/>To which I anſwer'd only what I had ſaid before upon that ſubject; That it was without Grounds that they reproach us after that manner: That they could not prove when this Alteration was made; nor could produce any Authentick Copy where the Name of <hi>Mahomet</hi> was ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. I added moreover, That this Comforter promiſed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> could not be <hi>Mahomet</hi> for this reaſon; Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, ſhould have taught the Apoſtles, and put 'em in mind of what <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had taught 'em; and this ought to have been his principal buſineſs; but has <hi>Mahomet</hi> done any of this? What ſtrange Oppoſition is there between his Maxims and thoſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt! Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of no thing but Mildneſs, Patience, Poverty, and Renouncing of himſelf! He would have a Man hate his own Fleſh, bear his Croſs every day, Love his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Pray for 'em, do 'em good, and ſuppreſs even the leaſt deſire of Revenge. But on the contrary, what does <hi>Mahomet</hi> teach? Why, his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:105141:102"/>inſpires nothing elſe but Rage, Violence, Pride, and the love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Spirit of Truth that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> promis'd in this Paſſage, ought to receive its Doctrine from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, The Doctrine of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> cannot be the ſame. Is not this true? be your ſelf Judge. Do not we find in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe two Laws, an endleſs Difference and Contradiction? When you retire into your Cell to meditate upon Divine Matters, I ſuppoſe you ſometimes take in your Hands our Holy Evangeliſts; where, it may be, you no ſooner read thoſe Divine Maxims with ſatisfaction, but you have immediately a mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 'em with thoſe of your <hi>Alcoran, Eh!</hi> Do it in the Name of that Great God you pretend to devote your ſelf to, by renouncing all the conveniencies of Life. And then tell me the difference; tell me your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Opinion. Here I began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he was mov'd; for he told me there was but little more requir'd to be ſaid to make him a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> That he had always had an extream Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105141:103"/>for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that he long ſince propos'd his humble, mean, poor Life, as a Pattern for him to imitate. Furthermore, he told me, He ſhould give a great deal of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to theſe things; and therefore deſired I would permit him more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conferences with me about 'em. I expreſs'd to him the great Satisfaction I had to hear him of theſe Sentiments; and that when he pleas'd, I was always at leaſure to wait on him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>It has been hitherto thought that the beſt way to deal with theſe Infidels was to make uſe of certain plauſible Arguments adapted to their Capacities, and which they would find forcible, becauſe of their weakneſs. As to tell 'em, That to think to waſh away their inward Impurities by the outward means of Baths, was as ridiculous as to waſh a Bottle of Ink without, when it would not be leſs Black within. But it ſeems to me unworthy of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and ſolidity of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to go no farther.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105141:103"/>ſerve for an Introduction to let in the true Light which they ought after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to have preach'd to 'em, upon the Holy Scriptures and Tradition, in which Two only conſiſts the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Otherwiſe it might happen to them as it did to certain Hereticks in <hi>France,</hi> who having been a little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Arguments were us'd to convert 'em; and being ſuffer'd to cool by a ſucceding neglect, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately grew angry with themſelves, as if they had been betray'd to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and ſo became Ten times more obſtinate than before. I affirm that it is very difficult to make uſe of the Authority of the Holy Scriptures to diſabuſe the <hi>Perſians,</hi> for they are falſely pre-poſſeſt with our altering them; therefore we muſt remove the Obſtacle, and agree with them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that they believe pure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: But, nevertheleſs, they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout again when we make uſe of the ſame Proofs that they do againſt us, and they are not able to draw thoſe Arguments they produce themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:105141:104"/>
               <p>Now you muſt not wonder at my free manner of diſputing with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi> I knew very well I was in <hi>Perſia</hi> when I did it, where the Laws allow Diſputes in matters of Religion:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How the</hi> Perſians <hi>differ from other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Religion.</hi>
                  </note> But in <hi>Turkey</hi> they are forbid under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Faggot.</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd that the <hi>Perſians</hi> do not well agree amongſt themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the points of Religion; but they do leſs agree with the other <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief foundation of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is about the Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> maintain it was <hi>Mortus Ali,</hi> Couſin German and Son-in-Law of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> But the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend on the contrary it was <hi>Omar,</hi> of whom they ſpeak modeſtly in reſpect of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who make a kind of God of their <hi>Ali.</hi> Obſerve how they ſpeak of him; <hi>Ali K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105141:104"/>the <hi>Turks</hi> have ſo much Horror, that they call the <hi>Perſians</hi> Blaſphemers and Idolaters.</p>
               <p>The Interpretations of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> by theſe two Nations are altogether contrary; and therefore becauſe they have their <hi>Codes</hi> and <hi>Ceremonials</hi> from hence, their Laws and Ceremoniés of their Religion are alſo different.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> waſh before Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by letting the Water run down from the top of their Arms to their Hands; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> quite contrary. Each defends his particular manner of Purifying, and maintains it againſt his Adverſary with ſo much heat, that they have both entire Volumes about it. Their Poſtures and Proſtrations in Praying are altogether contrary, and their Oppoſition goes even to their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> as I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have from the <hi>Jews</hi> their legal Impurities. They believe every thing impure that has but touch'd what was eſteem'd ſuch by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:105141:105"/>The mean People, and thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Law would not eaſily be prevail'd upon to touch any thing, or eat in the ſame Plate with <hi>Chriſtians, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> nay even with the Sect of <hi>Omar,</hi> as much <hi>Mahometans</hi> as they are. The <hi>Turks</hi> are not given to thoſe Superſtitions; they eat indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all the World, and, except it be <hi>Pork,</hi> without any diſtinction of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands. The Courtiers and Soldiers do the ſame thing in <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> hold,
<note place="margin">Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> that Diſſimulation is not only permitted, but neceſſary in Religion to avoid being ill treated by the <hi>Mahometans</hi> their Neighbours; for when they go amongſt 'em in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> they change their Habits and Turbans, and profeſs themſelves Followers of <hi>Omar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, on the other ſide, the <hi>Turks</hi> have this Diſſimulation in great abhorrence; for they never change thoſe Habits which diſtinguiſh their Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have a ſuperſtitious Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Green, becauſe, they ſay, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105141:105"/>Colour was conſecrated to their falſe Prophet; and they will condemn a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to death, that ſhall ever be known to wear it; but the <hi>Perſians,</hi> on the contrary, laugh at this Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſay in <hi>Perſia,</hi> that <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> ſhould ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Cha Abbas,</hi> to complain that he had ſuffer'd this Colour to be profan'd by the Chriſtians.

               </p>
               <p>There are at this Day a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the</hi> Gaures, <hi>or ancient</hi> Perſians.</note> who could never be perſuaded to change their Religion for the <hi>Mahometan;</hi> but theſe People do retain little of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, Knowledge, and Valour of their Anceſtors. They groan under a cruel Slavery: They are forbid the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts, and exerciſe only the mean Drudgery of Labourers, Gardeners, and Porters: They are always put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vileſt and moſt painful Works,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105141:106"/>inſomuch as their continu'd Slavery for many Ages, has at this day render'd 'em Cowardly, Simple, Ignorant, and Dull; yet they ſtill retain the ancient <hi>Perſian</hi> Idiom, and ſome few of 'em can read and write it. This Language is altogether different from the modern; but of no more uſe than common Talk amongſt them, for it ſerves neither for Learning nor Commerce.</p>
               <p>Their Belief is contain'd in ſeveral Skins, which their <hi>Magi,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> read to 'em upon certain Days; theſe Skins are fill'd with Fables and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Traditions, but which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs kept private by their Prieſts, for they make it a point of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not to ſhow 'em to any body; ſo that 'tis impoſſible to know any more of their Faith, than whiat is diſcover'd by their Prieſts; and they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo dull, that there is little or nothing to be learn'd from them.</p>
               <p>The modern <hi>Perſians</hi> call 'em <hi>Gavres,</hi> that is, Idolaters, and treat 'em worſe than they do the <hi>Jews;</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe 'em of worſhipping the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105141:106"/>the <hi>Fire,</hi> But however great my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity has been, I have been able to know but little of 'em; yet this I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That they have no Images, and that they very much abhorr thoſe that have. When you ask 'em why they fall down before the Riſing Sun? they ſhall anſwer, That they do Homage to that Creature, which is the moſt perfect next to Man, that God hath made out of nothing. They ſay alſo, That God has eſtabliſh'd his Throne there, and that his Glorious Majeſty muſt needs merit their ſo humble Reſpects. This Salutation they pay the Riſing Sun, is not particular to them, the modern <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo make uſe of it by profound Reverences, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> by frequent Croſſing themſelves. They ſay they believe Fire worthy of Reſpect, becauſe it is the pureſt of all Elements. The care they take to keep it alight, is very ſcrupulous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, for they dare not blow, for fear of polluting it with their Breath; and then they would believe themſelves defil'd, if they ſhould chance to let fall any Filth upon the Wood they burn.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:105141:107"/>
               <p>They don't obſerve Circumciſion;
<note place="margin">No Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</note> their Prieſts preſent their new-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to the Sun, and before the Fire; and ſo they believe 'em ſanctified by this Ceremony.</p>
               <p>They believe a Paradiſe,
<note place="margin">Their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, where.</note> which they ſay is within the Sphere of the Sun. The Happineſs of their Saints conſiſts in viewing the Sun clearly, in which, they ſay, they ſee God by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, as in a Glaſs. But no body is admitted to this Felicity, 'till three Days after his death; and that is the reaſon they carry three Days Proviſion to their Tombs, that they may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hunger nor thirſt. The poor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> and in their abſence the Birds and Dogs, profit themſelves by this Superſtition.</p>
               <p>They believe Hell to be a Priſon under-ground,
<note place="margin">Their Hell, where.</note> damp and ſtinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every-where full of Worms, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and other ſorts of Inſects, but above all a great number of Crows and Frogs; for 'tis theſe two ſorts of Animals that they have the greateſt averſion for. They call Crows Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105141:107"/>and Heralds of the Devil; and Frogs, Muſicians to the Damn'd.</p>
               <p>The manner of examining what ſhall be their Lott in the other Life, is very pleaſant: They carry the dead body out of the Town; they ſet it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Wall, with its face towards the Eaſt; then the Prieſts and Parents of the Dead retire to a convenient diſtance, where they obſerve what notice the Crows take of it: If they fall firſt upon the Right Eye, (for with the Eyes they commonly begin) then it is a ſign of Predeſtination, and they play and dance about the Carkaſs with a great deal of Joy: But if it be the Left, that's an Argument they are not pure enough to be admitted into the Sphere of the Sun; nor yet impure enough to be condemn'd to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Priſon of Hell, but muſt remain ſome time in the middle Region of the Air, there to endure the Cold, and from thence to be tranſlated to the Fire to be purify'd. At theſe Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals they are ſad and mourn. If the Crows pick out both their Eyes, then the Prieſts pronounce 'em damn'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105141:108"/>having no more Eyes, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not view the Sun. The Funerals of theſe laſt are moſt lamented.</p>
               <p>They have Saints which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<note place="margin">Saints, and how become ſo.</note> and they ſay that the way to become ſuch, is to work to purifie the Elements; to till the Ground; to cultivate the Gardens; to purge the Water of Infects; and, to keep the Fire alight. Theſe are their daily Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By the Principles of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they are oblig'd to leave in their Wills a certain Summ, to rid the Ponds of ſuch a number of Frogs, Toads, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and other Inſects. They alſo leave ſomething for People to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Carrion which the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> let ſtink in the Streets. To purifie the Air, and to preſerve the Towns from Contagion, is a very pious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Their moſt Venerable Saint was <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſter,</hi> a famous Aſtrologer, who firſt taught Aſtronomy to the ancient <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Magi,</hi> and perhaps that 'tis from him that they learn'd to worſhip the Sun. But the <hi>Gavres</hi> nevertheleſs will tell
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105141:108"/>you, that they do not worſhip this Planet, but only one God; but Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſay the contrary; we know that <hi>Armenia</hi> has been honour'd with a great many Martyrs, that choſe rather to die than adore the Sun. How to reconcile this with the <hi>Gavres</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I cannot well tell; but I am apt to believe theſe People are aſham'd to own their Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Their Chief Feaſt is call'd <hi>Nau-Rous,</hi> that is, a <hi>New Day;</hi> for 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Firſt Day of the Year. They begin this Feaſt the very ſame minute the <hi>Sun</hi> enters into <hi>Aries;</hi> it laſts Eight Days, all which they ſpend in Dancing, Sports, and Jovialty, in Honour of the <hi>Sun.</hi> The modern <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo retain this Feaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gavres</hi> ſeem to me to differ leſs from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than the modern <hi>Perſians,</hi> for their Manners are much purer; they are brought up and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in the Boſom of Poverty, and have a good Diſpoſition to the Goſpel if they could be but made more attentive.</p>
